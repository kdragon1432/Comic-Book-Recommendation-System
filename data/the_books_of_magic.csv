lit room to discuss a young boy who has a natural power for magic. It is an uneasy gathering. Occult says they should help the boy channel his power for good, while E says they ought to kill him to prevent him from ever turning evil. Constantine doesn't really want anything to do with the situation. The Stranger, who appears to be somewhat in charge, says that they must only offer him a choice. Occult mentions that the Cold Flame, a group of evil magicians is also after the child. The Stranger manages to convince the others that it is up to the four of them to make sure that the boy chooses correctly.</p><p>While the four have been talking, a young boy has been skateboarding nearby. He hears a tapping that seems to be coming from every direction. He stops, turns around and is frightened to find Mister E directly behind him. E grimly asks him if he believes in magic; the boy takes off running. He goes down an alleyway, only to find Dr. Occult who tells him that they only want to talk. The boy(whose name we learn is Tim) skates away and nearly misses hitting the Phantom Stranger. Thinking that he's clear, he finally stops outside a magic shop to catch his breath, only to be grabbed by the cigarette-smoking John Constantine.</p><p>Constantine tells Tim that he and his friends aren't going to hurt him; they just want to talk. The three other mystics appear, and the Stranger re-asks E's question. ""Do you believe in magic?"" After Tim's sarcastic retort, the Stranger asks him a final time. Tim tells him that he used to when he was younger. He used to wish magic was real, but he grew out of it. The Stranger tells the lad that magic IS real, and the four introduce themselves. Tim learns that names have power, and he should never tell anyone his real name. Also, instead of asking someone's name, he should ask what they would like to be called. Tim looks at them in disbelief and and asks them if he's on a <i>Candid Camera</i>. Occult assures him that there is no camera, and that they want to offer Tim a choice. To prove that magic is real, Occult takes Tim's yo-yo and clasps it in his hands. He releases them and an owl flies out. Tim gasps and asks if he could learn to do that. The Stranger tells Tim that in time, he could. He tells Tim that they want to educate him; and asks Tim to go with him. Tim thinks to himself that if he could do stuff like that, nobody would ever mess with him again. He accepts the Stranger's offer, and the owl flies back down and lands on Tim's shoulder. The Phantom Stranger creates a door and the two walk through.</p><p>They enter total blackness. Tim expresses fear, but the Stranger tells him that nothing in the past can hurt him. Tim asks where they are; the Stranger informs him that they are not anyWHERE. They are in the void at the dawn of time. Tim hears a loud, painful noise that sounds like screaming. The Stranger says that the painful cry of birth... the birth of everything. A light appears in the distance. The Stranger describes it as the Silver City, and sadly says that he can go no further. Suddenly, a light shines down from the city. Tim describes it as looking ""like Star Wars"". The Stranger tells him that it is the result of the first war; the war in Heaven. The ""light"" is actually the falling angels. Six giants stand in a circle, each wearing a different colored robe. The Phantom Stranger tells Tim that they are the archangels. The Stranger then tells Tim that it is time to visit Earth. As they approach the Earth, the Stranger tells Tim that while it is true that the Earth was once a molten ball of lave, in another frame of reference it is true that the Earth was once a concave dish full of the pre-dead(demons).</p><p>The two walk through Earth's past, past the death of the dinosaurs, until they reach the destruction of Atlantis. The Stranger informs Tim that this isn't the true Atlantis, this was just the last archipelago. They approach a toothless old man sitting alone on a rock. The man surprises Tim by talking to him. Tim asks the man if he can see him, but the man responds that he can't see or hear him. Still, his spells told him that Tim would be there. As the man was saying, Atlantis doesn't have a ""quantifiable existence."" There have been many Atlantises, and will be many more. Atlantis is a symbol of magic; the true Atlantis is inside everyone. It is our birthplace and our unattainable goal. Moving on to the subject of magic, the wizened old man tells Tim that basically it's a bunch of crap. Definitely not worth the price. He tells the Phantom Stranger to take Tim away, and advises Tim not to take the Trenchcoat Brigade's offer.</p><p>Tim and the Stranger continue their walk through the ages of magic. They see a prehistoric shaman, ancient Egypt, a Chinese sorceress, and representations of Greek rituals. Tim begins to feel sick, and the Phantom Stranger apologizes for moving so fast. They stop in Winchester, England, where they meet a teenaged boy. The teen introduces himself as Merlin. When Tim asks how Merlin can see them, he responds that he is the greatest wizard of his time due to his demon blood. He then goes into detail about his future life. Of how he'll Arthur become king, but will become infatuated by Nimue. Of how she'll betray him and seal him in cave to die. At least, Merlin points out, it will be interesting. A young boy enters and asks Merlin who he's talking to because he can't see anyone. Merlin introduces the boy as Iason, and tells him that of course he can't see anyone. Tim is puzzled and asks Merlin that if he knows the future is going to end so bad, why doesn't he try to change it. Merlin solemnly tells him he can't... ""magic grants no freedoms"". As the two leave, Tim asks the Stranger if he could be as powerful as Merlin. The Stranger tells him that while he isn't of demon blood, he could indeed be that powerful. Tim ponders the fact that Merlin's life wouldn't be worth the cost of magic, but he was going to do it anyway. He tells the Strange that wants to see more.</p><p>They walk through the Salem Witch Trials to show Tim that people kill what they fear. He explains to Tim about the differences between science and magic and how the two are rarely compatible. They continue walking. The Stranger show Tim Kent Nelson and the helmet of Nabu; and then asks Tim to take a seat. They appear to be in a theater of some sort, and a well-dressed with a top hat appears on-screen. The Phantom Stranger tells Tim that the man is Zatara; father of Zatanna, the famous stage magician. Zatara recites a poetic monologue about his life and pulls a bloody rabbit out of his hat. As the screen goes dark, Tim notices a man in a turban sitting next to him. The man begins speaking, and the Stranger tells Tim that the man is Sargon the Sorceror; a magician who gave his life to protect heaven. Sargon begins grotesquely melting and pointing his finger at Tim, he intones that, ""It's got a price. Nothing's free"". The Stranger grabs Sargon's ruby from the melted goo and asks Tim if he wants it. Tim doesn't know, and the Stranger tells him that makes sense.</p><p>The two walk through the exit, and the Stranger tells Tim that he has taken him as far as he can. The exit, and appear coming out of the magic shop's door. John Constantine tells Tim that he's going to be his next guide and asks Tim if he wants to bring his owl. Tim agrees, and the two begin walking. As Tim and Constantine head off into the distance, E grimly informs the others that he thinks they should still kill him.</p>",,,,,,,False,32134,"{'icon_url':

Tim is confused; the last thing he remembers is leaving the magic shop. He asks John about his passport, but John reveals that he doesn't have one either and he tells Tim that he worries too much. He mentions that they'll be landing in New York in an hour, and John goes to to have a nice chat with a flight attendant.</p><p>After John leaves, a bald man with a moustache who is sitting next to Tim, introduces himself as Boston Brand. Brand informs Tim that there's been a lot of talk about him in the netherworld. He warns Tim about the Cold Flame; an evil cult who is searching for him. Tim just thinks the man is mad, and pays him little mind. John returns with a bruised face.</p><p>After they land at JFK, Tim is amazed as he and John just walk straight through customs without being stopped. They get in taxi and head to Greenwich Village, where they visit John's old friend, Madame Xanadu.</p><p>They enter Madame Xanadu's place, where she bids her guests welcome... until she discovers one is John Constantine. She orders him to get out, and yells at him for stealing something called ""the Wind's Egg"". She continues to threaten him, until John offers to apologize and tells Tim to go stand outside for a few seconds. While Tim waits outside, their cab driver is on the phone speaking to someone. The driver tells the person on the line that he won't have any problem taking care of the boy.</p><p>After a while, John comes out to bring Tim back inside. He introduces Tim to Madame Xanadu, and she prepares to read his cards. John asks her if they can skip it because they're in a hurry, but Madame X says that she'll only do the simplest reading. She hands her tarot deck to Tim to shuffle and asks him to pick four cards. She is unsurprised to find that they're all major arcana. The first card is The Hermit and it represents where Tim has come from: somebody who introduced Tim to hidden knowledge. The second card represents the present and it is The Wheel of Fortune: a gambler, opportunities, and danger. The third card is The Empress and it symbolizes where Tim is going: somebody who understands their female side; multiple powerful women. The final card represents Tim's ultimate destination and it is Justice, reversed: an important decision; great darkness; a blind judge. Madame Xanadu apologizes that the reading couldn't be more specific and wishes him luck. She gives him a gift which turns out to be Tim's pet owl Yo-yo.</p><p>On their way upstairs to see a detective named Corrigan, Tim asks John about the Wind's Egg. John admits to taking it. He had planned on returning it, but a troll in Birmingham broke it. Tim scoffs. They both fail to notice their cab driver taking a sniper-rifle from the trunk of his car.</p><p>John tells Corrigan's secretary that he wants to see him, and while they wait he tells Tim a little about Corrigan's past. Corrigan was killed back in the 30's, but was brought back to life and bonded to something... else. Sometimes Corrigan's other is one of the most powerful beings in the universe; other times it's just a dude in green tights. His other is called... The Spectre, but it's Corrigan who finishes John's sentence. Corrigan ushers them into his office and asks John how he knew all this. John replies the The Spectre knows him, and he introduces Tim and Corrigan. Corrigan entertains his guests by affecting a horrible British accent, his generally clueless attitude about Britain in general. Suddenly, Corrigan transforms into the Spectre. He flies across the street where the cab driver was prepared to assassinate Tim with the sniper rifle. He grabs the assassin and changes him into a pile of ash. The Spectre returns and greets Tim and John. He informs them of the sniper, and warns Tim to stay pure. The Spectre transforms back into Corrigan, and Tim and John quickly say their goodbyes.</p><p>As they walk, a newspaper blows past with the headline ""Another Teenage Slaying"". Tim asks John if he should call his dad and let him know where he's at, but John responds that the other members of the Trenchcoat Brigade would have taken care of that. Tim remarks how the Spectre looked like the angels that the Phantom Stranger showed him in the past. John tells him that it's possible.</p><p>They're still walking when Dr. Fate appears before them in front of a fire station. He gives them a message from the other members of the Trenchcoat Brigade: the forces of evil have put a bounty on Tim; John needs to find him a safe place to stay and then rejoin them for their battle. The three of them walk aways, and Tim tells Fate that he saw his helmet in the past; it was some kind of god. Dr. Fate tells him that it is no longer a god; now it is a thing made of pure order. He explains to Tim that life is like a Venn diagram: where chaos and order intersect; there is life.</p><p>They continue walking until the streets surrounding them becomes an airplane. Dr. Fate disappears, and Tim and John take their seats. Despite Tim's wishes for a Southern Comfort, John orders him a ginger ale to drink, and heads to the restroom. The African gentleman sitting next to Tim, whispers to him and announces that he's Boston Brand. Tim remarks on how different looks; Brand informs him that he's dead and just borrowing this body. Brand asks Tim what he thinks of Constantine. Tim tells the dead man that John seems okay, but he's curious as to how easy they get from place to place. Brand explains to Tim, that he and John are riding the ""synchronicity freeway"", so things just fall in place for them. He holds up a newspaper with the headline ""Boy Number 8's Body Found in Sewer"", and is about to tell Tim something very important, but John returns with a red palm print on his face and asks Tim who he was speaking to. He introduces Boston Brand, but the African man looks confused and responds that his name is Matheson.</p><p>Meanwhile, the other members of the Trenchcoat Brigade are standing outside the Citadel of the Cold Flame. Dr. Occult asks the Phantom Stranger if he really thinks the three of them can stop them. Mr E is confident, the Stranger less so. However, the Stranger says that he cannot allow the Cold Flame to kill Tim. E replies that they should let Tim die, because it would solve all their potential problems. He quotes a saying that his father had. The Stranger is unmoved, and Dr. Occult and points out that they know very well what happened to E's father. E becomes enraged. He lifts up his cane, and takes care of an assassin who had approached behind him, and tells the Occult that those were foul lies and his father was a great man. The Stranger tells E that if he wants to leave, to go ahead. E responds that he gave his word and he intends to stick with it. The Phantom Stranger tells them they will create a plan to attack the Citadel, in the meantime they must remain confident that John Constantine knows what he is doing...</p><p>Meanwhile, John and Tim are now walking through the streets of Washington. With the help of Boston Brand they survive another assassination attempt, and finally arrive at Baron Winter's place. They ring the Baron's doorbell; when he answers he is disappointed to see Constantine. He informs John that he is entertaining a dinner guest and asks them both to leave. John responds that they're both starving, and people are trying to kill Tim. He asks the Baron for a bite to eat, and then they'll be out of his hair. Before the Baron can answer; his pet leopard growls and scares Yo-yo, who flies inside the house. Tim goes rushing in after, and with no small amount of frustration; Baron Winter allows Constantine inside.</p><p>Tim finds Yo-yo, and notices that Jason Blood(who he met in the past with the Stranger) is the Baron's dinner guest. Everybody sits down and prepares to eat. Winter angrily tells John that he is not welcome; he is to eat and leave. John asks Blood if he has any advice for Tim. Blood forcefully grabs the boy's arm and warns him not to do it. He tells him of the consequences; including Hell. John then asks the same question of Baron Winter. The Baron replies that magic is unimportant; it's just parlor tricks and card games. What is important is being yourself, solitude, civilization, and by the way there's ketchup in the container to the left.</p><p>After they leave the Baron's house, Tim and John find a parked car and hop inside. Tim asks John if he's sure he's one of the good guys. John tells him that there are no ""good guys and bad guys""; there's just people trying to survive. Tim asks where they're going. John replies that they're heading to San Francisco. Tim begins to freak out, both at the distance they're traveling and at John's poor driving. John commands Tim to go to sleep, which he promptly does.</p><p>Tim finally wakes up after their car is run off a cliff by another assassin. Forced to hitchhike, he and John catch a ride with renowned skeptic, Dr. Terry Thirteen. John tells Thirteen that Tim is interested in magic, and asks him for his opinions on the subject. Dr. Thirteen explains that he's been investigating magic for over fifteen years and has never found an instance of the paranormal that didn't have a rational explanation. Thirteen goes on to say that if magic existed, he would have found evidence of it by now.</p><p>They arrive in San Francisco and thank Dr. Thirteen for the ride. John reveals to Tim that magic doesn't exist for the doctor. You have to CHOOSE magic, and that's what they're offering Tim.</p><p>As they approach their destination, John explains that they're going to see the famous stage magician, Zatanna. John tells Tim that he and Zatanna are old friends, which causes Tim to worry; considering how their visits to John's other ""friends"" came out. However, Zatanna greets them warmly and gives John a letter that had arrived that morning for him from India. John reads it and immediately starts swearing. He tells Zatanna to keep an eye on Tim, and rushes out the door for Calcutta.</p><p>Tim offers to leave, but Zatanna tells him that's nonsense. She lets him take a shower, and conjures him up some clean clothes. She asks him if there's anyone he needs to call, and Tim decides that it's a probably a good idea to call his dad. Tim calls his father and tries to tell him that he's okay and in America, but for some reason his dad thinks that he's staying with relatives in Brighton and is unable to hear otherwise. It begins to hit Tim that he's alone, but Zatanna tells him that he's under her protection and she won't let any harm come to him. To cheer him up, she decides to show him some San Francisco sights.</p><p>As they tour the city, Zatanna stops somewhere to use the restroom. While she's occupied, a little boy wearing a skeleton costume comes up to Tim and explains that he's Boston Brand, again. He tells Tim about all the chaos and carnage that's happening in India between the Trenchcoat Brigade and the Cold Flame. Zatanna returns, and Brand leaves the child's body. Tim mentions to Zatanna that he saw her father in the past, and how he didn't seem to have a happy life. Zatanna replies that she doesn't think he did, either.</p><p>Later that night, Zatanna takes Tim to a Halloween party at a local black magic club. The bouncer at first refuses to let them in; until he recognizes Zatanna. The club is full of all manner of creatures and demons and wizards. She introduces Tim to some of the dark magicians, including Tala, Felix Faust and the Wizard, and the piano-playing Tannarak. A giant comes up to Tim, and warns him to leave. It's Boston Brand again, and he's about to warn Tim of something he overheard, but the giant casts a spell and ejects the dead man from his head.</p><p>Tannarak takes the stage and addresses the club patrons. He tells them all about all the commotion in Calcutta. Zatanna suddenly gets very nervous and realizes that she shouldn't have brought Tim. Tannarak announces that the boy everyone is looking for is in the audience. There's a bounty on Tim's head, ""which need not be attached to his body"". Zatanna shouts that Tim is under her protection, but Tannarak just scoffs. After all, there is many of them and only one of her. Tim and Zatanna are surrounded by an approaching hoard of demonic creatures. Things aren't looking good... until John Constantine enters the club. He lights a cigarette and coolly announces that ""nobody touches the boy"". He tells the demons that they should all know who he is, and asks them if they really start to something. Tim, John, and Zatanna leave the club without further incident.</p><p>Outside, Zatanna expresses her confusion to John. He doesn't have that much power, but the demons were SCARED of him. John tells her that a good magician never reveals his secrets. They say their goodbyes and at John's request she conjures up some airplane tickets and passports for them.</p><p>Onboard the airplane back to the UK, Boston Brand possesses a stewardess and makes sure Tim is okay. Brand tells Tim that he'll see around. John asks Tim what all he learned on their trip to America. Tim remarks that all of them but Zatanna are crazy, that you have to CHOOSE magic, and that most magic users live in an almost shadowy version of the real world. John tells Tim that Dr. Occult will be waiting for in Gatwick to take Tim on the next leg of his journey. Tim asks where he's heading next. John's answer?

Tim asks Occult if he's a real doctor. Occult responds that he's not a medical doctor, though he can do minor procedures such as setting a bone. They stop under a tree, and Occult tells Tim that they have to wait there until twilight. While they wait, they discuss the other members of the Trenchcoat Brigade. As the time to leave nears, Occult asks Tim to empty his pockets and leave everything metal behind. He informs Tim that there are a few things he MUST remember: 1)Obey Occult's orders no matter how strange they are 2)Don't ask any questions or favors of anyone they meet, and don't accept any gifts without Occult's permission 3)Remember his manners; politeness is extremely important, and 4) NEVER stray from the path. As the two set off on their journey, Tim questions the wisdom of his decision to come.</p><p>The two cross a stream by carefully walking on stones, and Occult warns Tim not to get his feet wet. They approach a wooden gate and Tim asks if they're really going to Fairyland like John said. Occult tells Tim to look behind. He does so, and instead of the field and stream, there is a vast ocean. He tells Tim they have already left his world; the gate exists in both. He warns Tim that when they cross the gate's threshold, he might notice a few changes. Which is true, because after they enter the gate, Dr. Occult is gone and replaced with a young dark-haired woman. She tells Tim that she is no longer Dr. Occult. Tim asks the woman her name; she tells him to find one. Tim looks around, and notices a rose bush. He decides to call her Rose, and she is pleased.</p><p>They enter a huge Market full of magical creatures and items. One market lady offers Tim his heart's desire for a year of his life. While Tim is turning down the old lady's offer, he doesn't notice an imp putting something in back pocket. Tim's owl Yo-yo does, however and attacks the imp. Rose asks what's going on and the imp angrily demands compensation for being attacked by the owl. Rose asks Yo-yo if that's true. Yo-yo hoots in response, and Rose informs the imp that Yo-yo said he was trying a bracelet in Tim's pocket. Glory, the warden of the market, appears and berates the imp(named Snout) for trying to get Tim accused of theft. Glory tells Tim that he may claim restitution for Snout's act, and orders Snout to lead them to his barrow which is full of items and knick-knacks. Glory tells Tim, Rose, and Yo-yo that they may each choose an item of Snout's to take for free. Rose chooses a mirror, Yo-yo a necklace, and Tim chooses an egg. Glory is especially impressed by Tim's choice of a Mundane Egg, and wonders how someone like Snout could have ended up with one. Rose and Tim bid Glory their farewells, and set off on their journey once more.</p><p>Tim states that he's hungry and asks if there's anything to eat. Rose warns him not to eat anything in Faerie; at least not if he wants to return home the same time as he left. She then warns him to watch his step as they fall into a sea of blood. They crawl ashore and Rose explains that it's a metaphor for fertility and mystery, but since they're in Faerie, there is no metaphor. Though the blood is wet and messy, Rose informs him that it will soon vanish. Nothing lasts very long there.</p><p>They walk down a path, and approach a cave where a giant is standing guard. Rose becomes Dr. Occult again and asks entrance into the cave. The giant offers to let them in if they solve a riddle. Thanks to the mirror that he picked up in Market, Occult is able to solve the riddle. Tim considers that to be very lucky. Dr. Occult is more ambiguous.</p><p>Inside the cave, they find a man playing a harp, who is sitting next to the body of a dead king. The man is delighted to have visitors, and introduces himself as Thomas. Thomas seems to recognize Dr. Occult and calls him Melchior, though Occult denies this. Thomas mentions that Melchior had a women named Rose with him. They made love once, and he wonders if Rose would remember him. Occult replies that he doubts it. Tim asks who the dead man is, and Thomas tells him that he is he King Who Sleeps Beneath the Hill; in his country's time of greatest need he will rise once more. Tim wonders of he means King Arthur, to which Thomas replies that he is King Arthur... And Charlemagne, and Brian Boru, and all the others.</p><p>Tim and Occult continue walking on the path through the cave, but now it is do dark that they cannot see. Tim exits the cave, only to find that Dr. Occult is nowhere to be seen. Tim walks down the path for a ways. He sees Dr. Occult approaching a wooden house, and Occult calls for him. Tim rushes over, but ""Dr. Occult"" turns into the hideous with, Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga captures Tim and plans to eat him. She hangs him upside down in her house, which begins walking on giant chicken legs.</p><p>Baba Yaga decides that she needs vegetables if she's going to make Tim stew, so she flies away on her pestle. Two animals who are hanging up next to Tim begin talking to him about Baba Yaga; suddenly Yo-yo flies in. Tim tells Yo-yo to fly away and find Dr. Occult. Yo-yo hoots in response and the other animals translate it as saying that Yo-yo doesn't know where Occult is. The other animals notice the necklace that Yo-yo picked up at Market, and marvel that at how an owl managed to find ""Empusa's Infinitely Extensible"". Yo-yo flies out the window, and begins wrapping the infinitely extending chain around the house's chicken legs; causing the house to fall. Tim and the other animals escape from the rubble, only to find Baba Yaga flying back from her vegetable gathering expedition. She chases after Tim. Tim trips over a tree root, but falls right in front of Rose. Rose explains that Tim is under her protection, but Baba Yaga is furious about her house. Rose warns the old witch that if she doesn't release Tim, Rose will shout Yaga's true name throughout the forest. Bitterly, Baba Yaga allows them to leave. Tim figures that Rose was bluffing, but she denies this. She tells him that once when she was younger she visited the Mansions of Madness and drank a special wine. She learned the true names of many things and would have destroyed Baba Yaga.</p><p>They continue walking along the path, until they are met by a regal lady on horseback. The lady recognizes Rose, though she recognizes her as a man. She asks Rose to introduce Tim, and she does so. Rose tells the queen that she is showing Tim the distant worlds. The queen decides that they will visit her palace. Tim asks her if it's very far. The queen answers that it is not, and suddenly they are there.</p><p>The queen talks to Tim and makes several cryptic statements. She tells him that the places he will visit do not really exit, therefore they are all that matters. They provide an escape from the ""real world"". The queen picks up a key and offers it to Tim as a gift. She tosses it to him, and he catches it before he can react. Rose shouts out, but it is too late. Tim has accepted the queen's gift. The queen tells them to go on and see the far worlds. She rings a bell and asks her page Hamnet for a strawberry. She smiles slyly as Rose and Tim leave.</p><p>Dr. Occult shows Tim several worlds. First is Skartaris, where Travis Morgan reigns as Warlord. She shows him Nightmaster battling a dark figure, Princess Amethyst of Gemworld, and also the Demon,Etrigan, in Hell.</p><p>The final place they visit is a dark and misty world, where two figures in party hats sit in a cemetery. The men introduce themselves as Cain and Abel, rulers of the Dreaming. The Lord Shaper, the real lord of the Dreaming, approaches them from behind. Cain and Abel quickly apologize and claim that they were just playing a joke. Dream recognizes Tim, and tells him that he is always welcome in this realm. He asks Tim to give his regards to Titania.</p><p>Tim and Dr. Occult return to the queen's castle. Occult thanks the queen and bids her farewell, but she reminds him that Tim accepted the gift of the key. By Faerie rules, that means he has to stay. Tim protests, but Occult solemnly tells him that rules are rules. He vows to come back with the Trenchcoat Brigade and raze Faerie if they have to. Tim becomes very upset and asks if there's NOTHING they can do. The queen smiles and tells Tim that the only way he would be able to leave would be to give her a gift equal to the one she gave him; the key of worlds. Tim replies that the only thing he has is the egg he got from Market; calling it the Ordinary Egg. Occult realizes that Tim is talking about the Mundane Egg. He tells Tim that the egg is very valuable; one day it will hatch a world. Occult offers the egg to the queen in exchange for Tim, and due to the rules of Faerie she is forced to accept the trade. She takes the egg and orders them to leave.

outside the magic shop waiting for Tim and Dr. Occult to return. John asks E about a rumor he had heard. According to a man in Nepal, E always carries a stake in case he runs into vampires and gun loaded with silver bullets in case he he runs into werewolves. To John's surprise, E pulls out a stake covered with dried blood and tells him that, ""the only good vampire is a dead vampire"".</p><p>Tim and Occult come walking up; fresh from their trip to Faerie. Tim tells the Trenchcoat Brigade that he's ready for his final journey, and is prepared to bring Yo-yo with him. E stops him and says that the bird is a creature of darkness and cannot go. Tim reluctantly acquiesces, and grabs Mr. E's arm. Together, they go walking into the future. Constantine express his doubts about letting Tim leave with E, but Phantom Stranger tells him that they have no choice: E is the only one who can travel to the future.</p><p>E takes Tim fifteen years into the future. Or rather as he explains, <em>A</em> future. E explains to the boy that no future is certain, but some are more certain than others. They step forward to find a huge magical battle being waged. All sorts of magicians and magical creatures are involved in this war. E tells Tim that it is the final battle of magic in this age. Tim asks who wins, but E tells him that some times one side wins and some times the other does. Not only that, but in many futures the lineups of each side are different, also. E sometimes feels that he alone is pure.</p><p>Tim notices a gravely wounded John Constantine laying against a wall. He goes over to talk to him. John recognizes him, and angrily remarks that they should have killed him when they had the chance. Tim is confused, so John points to the leader of the evil magical forces who is revealed to be an adult Timothy Hunter. Tim asks Mr. E if that's really him. E tells him that it is, but hesitates and then repeats that this isn't the only future. In some alternative futures, Tim is a champion of light and in others he is totally uninvolved. Tim wonders if the current future they're in is more likely to occur than the others; to which E responds ""no"". Tim angrily asks him what the point was of showing him this horrible future. E simply replies that he felt Tim should see it.</p><p>E and Tim continue their trek into the future. E tells Tim about how the magical war will be the last burst of magic in the current era; and how afterwards there will be a ""real"" war which will paralyze civilization. E begins talking about his father, and reveals that the reason he is blind is because his father cut his eyes out after catching him looking at a picture of a woman ""with lust in his heart"". Tim declares that's sick, but E believes his father to have been a good man.</p><p>Tim and E reach a future full of gleaming skyscrapers and blimps. E tells Tim that at this point in time, people have no time for magic. Eventually though, magic will return, and we see a double page spread of the Legion of Superheroes era. E feels that this is an evil era of miscegenation with people breeding with beings worse than animals, but it will be the grand return of magic. Tim asks Mr. E what goes wrong. E is puzzled, but Tim tells him that something always goes wrong. E bitterly tells him that he has a defeatist attitude, but unfortunately he's right. The Archmage will awaken, and wild magic will reign. However, the Archmage will destroy half of it's world, thus destroying itself and placing most magic out of humanity's grasp. <em>""And science and logic and cold rationality held illimitable dominion over all.""</em></p><p>They go forward, and Tim wonders if that is the end of magic. E reveals that there is STILL magic. After all, the magical items remain. They approach a temple where a mask sits on a pedestal. Tim notices how it resembles the helmet of Dr. Fate; only it's not gold. The mask starts talking, and raspingly orders it's acolyte to put it on. The acolyte does so, and is transformed into a hideous creature. The creature that would once have been Dr. Fate remembers Tim, and tells him that all that crap about order and chaos was just that. Crap. The creature orders them away, the mask demands that the acolyte now remove him. The acolyte pleads, but the corrupt mask is relentless. Finally, the servant removes the helmet, and along with it; his face. Tim remarks on how disgusting that was. Mr. E tells Tim how he once tried to convince all the heroes to band together and destroy the helmet of Nabu in the present to prevent it's corruption, but they all thought he was crazy.</p><p>After a brief stop in the 60th century where they encounter the people who sent the villain Abrakadabra back in time, E and Tim enter the far, far future; near the end of the Earth. Tim is surprised to find that there are still people, but they are translucent green simpletons who go fishing for sea spiders. The ""people"" reveal that they can speak English. They tell the travelers that they learned it from somebody who was walking from the future. They ask Tim a question about sea spiders, and when he doesn't know they go back about their business. Tim asks E if this is how it ends. E replies that he doesn't know; he's never been this far into the future before. He tells Tim that he learned the art of ""walking forward"" from a blind man he met when he was younger. The blind man was walking backwards through time, though he could no longer remember why. Tim wants to go back home, but E tells him that they go further.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Trenchcoat Brigade is beginning to worry. The Phantom Stranger can no longer feel E and Tim, and becomes afraid that he made a mistake. Occult casts a spell on Yo-yo to find and protect Tim. Yo-yo flies off...</p><p>Tim and E are now in the very distant reaches in time. E asks Tim what it looks like. Tim tells him that everything looks strange. It's a strange blue color; the stars seem to be falling, and everything seems to be moving toward them. E remarks that what Tim is seeing is called ""indigo shift"". It's the end of the universe, and everything is moving back toward the center. E starts belting out a Duke Ellington song. Tim asks him what the name of it is, but E doesn't seem to know that he was singing. Tim points out a light in the distance, and they walk towards it.</p><p>They approach a bizarre-looking... ""place""; and are greeted by a man with a flowing white beard and high yellow hat. The man introduces himself as The Hierophant and asks the two what souls they are composed of. Despite E's order not to answer, Tim replies that they are from the past. The Hierophant is delighted to meet someone new, and takes them to meet the others.</p><p>The Hierophant reveals that he and everyone else are composed of the souls of everyone who was ever alive. They call their residence ""Terminus"", because they find it funny that there's nowhere else to travel to. The Hierophant introduces the two travelers to his King and Queen; and also to their Fool, who bears an uncanny resemblance to John Constantine. The Fool asks them a riddle. E answers, but declares that it is an evil riddle and he tells Tim that they need to leave. Before they go, Tim asks the Fool if he can tell him anything about magic. The Fool performs magic tricks, such as making light come from his hands and creating butterflies. He tells Tim that he knows nothing of magic; except that a ""little magic can be a dangerous thing"" before blinking out of existence.</p><p>This is it. Tim and E have now reached the end of the universe. It's pitch black, and there is nothing around. Tim remarks that he's bored and ready to go back, but Mr. E has other plans. He pulls the stake out of his coat and attempts to stab Tim with it. He tells Tim that he only wants to protect him from the world, so he won't be corrupted. He again tries to stake Tim, but Yo-yo comes swooping down from the past and sacrifices itself. E grabs Tim and begins strangling the boy. Suddenly, a hooded figure approaches and orders them to stop. The figure is Destiny of the Endless and discovers that the two are in his book as a footnote to a previous chapter. Death arrives and greets everyone. E tells her that she must be here for Tim, but Death responds that she's not here for either of them. Instead, she takes Destiny(to his relief), but tells the two that they can't stay and watch. It's the end of the universe after all. She hands E back his glasses and Tim back his yo-yo(former owl). Mr. E remarks that he has to kill Tim, but Death tells him that isn't his responsibility. E asks her what he's supposed to do. Death tells him that he has to go back the same way he came; by walking one step at time. E sets off on his way, and Tim worriedly asks if he's going to have to walk back also. Death rubs her hands through her hair, and tells Tim that he's walked far enough. She tells him to close his eyes...</p><p>The remaining members of the Trenchcoat Brigade are lamenting the loss of Tim. Suddenly, Tim appears and they greet him happily. They ask about Mr. E, and Tim replies that he has to walk all the way back through time. The Stranger expresses sympathy for E, even after what he tried to do to Tim. Tim asks Dr. Occult if he can bring Yo-yo back, but unfortunately he can't. The Stranger gets down to brass tacks and reminds Tim of everything he's seen on his journeys. He tells Tim that it's time for him to make his decision. Magic... or no? Tim thinks about it for a second. He hesitates, but tells the Brigade that the price is just too high. He asks the group if they're angry. The Stranger replies that it always his choice. The Brigade begins to vanish, and suddenly Tim has a change of heart and yells out that he DOES want it... but it is too late. He is left all alone standing in front of the abandoned magic shop.</p><p>Later, the Brigade is gathered around a table discussing the transpired events. John expresses bitterness that events ended so poorly. Occult remarks that he never believed Constantine to be stupid. John becomes angry, but Occult stops him. Suddenly, John realizes what REALLY happened. The choice that the Phantom Stranger offered Tim was really back at the very beginning when Tim decided to go with each of the Brigade. THAT was when Tim actually made his his choice about magic. John grins slyly at the Stranger and ask what they do next. The Stranger replies that they will wait; and Occult replies that they will see.</p><p>Tim finally arrives at home, where his dad is in the living room watching television. His father doesn't seem concerned, so Tim asks him how long he was out. His father guesses that it was only about six hours. Tim asks him about the phone call from San Francisco or Brighton, but his father has no idea what he's talking about. His father tells that he plans on ordering a pizza for dinner, and Tim goes up to his room. Tim sits on his bed holding his yo-yo. He tells the Brigade that he doesn't need them or anything all he needs is to believe. Suddenly, Tim's yo-yo changes back into an owl. With a look of joy on his face, Tim excitedly shouts out ""Magic!""</p><p> The story of Tim Hunter continued in <a href=""/mister-e/4050-25547/"" data-ref-id=""4050-25547"">Mister E</a> mini series.</p>",,,,,,,False,33647,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/2083743-04.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",4,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55794/', 'id': 55794, 'name': 'England', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/england/4020-55794/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56625/', 'id': 56625, 'name': 'Gemworld', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gemworld/4020-56625/'}]",The Road to Nowhere,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55768/', 'id': 55768, 'name': 'Book of Destiny', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/book-of-destiny/4055-55768/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55910/', 'id': 55910, 'name': ""Death's Ankh"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/deaths-ankh/4055-55910/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56063/', 'id': 56063, 'name': 'Helmet of Fate', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/helmet-of-fate/4055-56063/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43437/', 'id': 43437, 'name': 'Karen Berger', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/karen-berger/4040-43437/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40841/', 'id': 40841, 'name': 'Neil Gaiman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neil-gaiman/4040-40841/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-25075/', 'id': 25075, 'name': 'Paul Johnson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/paul-johnson/4040-25075/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6224/', 'id': 6224, 'name': 'Todd Klein', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/todd-klein/4040-6224/', 'role': 'letterer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic-4-the-road-to-nowhere/4000-33647/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-56539/', 'id': 56539, 'name': 'Dominators', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dominators/4060-56539/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-42802/', 'id': 42802, 'name': 'Fatal Five', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fatal-five/4060-42802/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-19241/', 'id': 19241, 'name': 'Legion of Super-Heroes', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-40483/', 'id': 40483, 'name': 'The Endless', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-endless/4060-40483/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-50689/', 'id': 50689, 'name': 'Trenchcoat Brigade', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/trenchcoat-brigade/4060-50689/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-4354/', 'id': 4354, 'name': 'The Books of Magic', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic/4050-4354/'}"

They are taught by Vuall.  However, unlike the real Molly, these Mollies all have their will sucked out.  Sir Timothy treats them all very badly.  Sir Timothy considers the state of affairs, in which he is one of the leaders of Earth, having used his magic to treat with demons.  However, he has a sudden dizziness, and seems to switch from his mansion to a shack.  He thinks the demon Barbatos can help him.</p><p>Araquel, a fallen angel, is chained above the pit of hell.  His ex-wife Khara and his daughter, Nikki, visit him.  Khara tells him he should free himself to be with them, but he thinks he can't.  She tells him she's going to London to stop someone (Tim) from making a mistake and ruining the world.</p><p>Young Tim, returned to London from Death and Faerie, runs into Molly outside.  (This is her first appearance in real time.)  They're friends, and Molly clearly likes Time, who's oblivious.  She asks him about California, where everyone thought he went when he was in Faerie. Tim suddenly realizes that today is the anniversary of his mother's death.  His dad usually drinks himself into a stupor on this day.  He wonders if he really cares any more, now that he knows that Bill isn't his real dad, and his dead mom, Mary, wasn't his real mom, but then he goes and visits her grave anyway.</p><p>Sir Timothy goes to find Barbatos, to ask why the world seems to be changing around him.  He thinks Barbatos is his slave demon, but really he's under Barbatos's control.  Barbatos says that their continuity is in danger because there are less of the young Tims who are likely to turn into the current Sir Timothy--in fact, there is only one Tim left who might turn into Sir Timothy.  If Sir Timothy wants to keep his own timeline stable, he'll have to travel back into the past with Barbatos to fix it.</p><p>Tim opens the envelope he got from Death, which is full of seeds.  He pours them on his mother's grave.</p><p>Sir Timothy, now in 1994, watches young Tim leave the cemetery.  He remembers how he slowly lost his memories of his life, trading them to demons for power and money. He begins to wonder if it was all worth it.</p><p>Khara and Nikki take a portrait of Mary from Bill while he sits in the car she died in.  They ambush Sir Timothy and throw him the portrait, which is so karmically heavy that it pins him to the ground. Khara warns Sir Timothy to say away from young Tim.</p><p>Sir Timothy manages to get away, and returns to his own time, looking for his current Molly, only to see that his mansion is again a shack.</p>",,,,,,,False,39597,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/35455-5239-39597-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",5,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56054/', 'id': 56054, 'name': 'Athanor House', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/athanor-house/4020-56054/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-42470/', 'id': 42470, 'name': 'Heaven', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heaven/4020-42470/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55798/', 'id': 55798, 'name': 'London', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/london/4020-55798/'}]",The Hidden School,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7866/', 'id': 7866, 'name': 'Charles Vess', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/charles-vess/4040-7866/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-52301/', 'id': 52301, 'name': 'John Ney Rieber', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-ney-rieber/4040-52301/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21173/', 'id': 21173, 'name': 'John Workman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-workman/4040-21173/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-51057/', 'id': 51057, 'name': 'Julie Rottenberg', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julie-rottenberg/4040-51057/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7069/', 'id': 7069, 'name': 'Peter Snejbjerg', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/peter-snejbjerg/4040-7069/', 'role': 'penciler, inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21184/', 'id': 21184, 'name': 'Sherilyn Van Valkenburgh', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sherilyn-van-valkenburgh/4040-21184/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42338/', 'id': 42338, 'name': 'Stuart Moore', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/stuart-moore/4040-42338/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic-5-the-hidden-school/4000-39597/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-5239/', 'id': 5239, 'name': 'The Books of Magic', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic/4050-5239/'}"

Daniel, last seen in THE CHILDREN'S CRUSADE, commits a murder and is banished from Free Country. In despair, he wanders London where he meets the traitorous Reverend Slaggingham, ruler of an underground home for outcasts and a man eager for aid in his plot against Tim Hunter. </i></p><p>In the dimension of the Free Country, Daniel argues with Spud about the girl Daniel loved, Marya. As they argue, Daniel throws him off a waterfall, becoming the first murderer in Free Country.</p><p>A spirit of Free Country tells him he must leave, and sends him to London (although he grew up there a hundred years earlier).</p><p>Tim shows up at Molly’s with some flowers to apologize. Molly accepts, and they go out for ice cream. As they go, he tells her that his dad has woken up, and is getting surgery for his face.</p><p>Reverend Slaggingham and two boys, Jimmy and Bizzie, see them walk by. Slaggingham tries to sell them various magical traps, and wants them to get Tim, but they’re his friends and tell him off. He blasts them with gutta-percha and turns them into statues.</p><p>Daniel looks for Marya in London for days but no longer knows his way around. He starts to hate everyone. He misses the grifters he grew up with in Victorian England, and goes down into the sewers.</p><p>Tim and Molly stop off at her dance studio so she can pick something up. The now-somewhat-grown Marya is there, dancing. She says she’ll come with Molly, and when she comes out, she and Tim recognize each other from the Children’s Crusade. Marya blurts out that Tim is Molly’s boyfriend, which Tim didn’t know, and also tells Molly that he’s a magician. He runs off, ranting about the craziness of life. They run smiling after him, but he lets his power go off by accident and freezes time all around him. However, Khara and Nikki show up.</p><p>Daniel gets lost in the sewers, but Sister Staylace finds him, and brings him to Slaggingham’s sewer base of operations, where he is planning against the surface world.

Titania and the Amadan, in London, pass by him with condescension.</p><p>Tim and Molly finally get to have some ice cream, and are observed by Circe, a tattoo artist.</p><p>Staylace--now going by her first name, Gwendolyn--runs into Tim and Molly, and introduces them to Auberon, who still hasn't put his soul back in his body.  A mental construct of Gwendolyn teaches Auberon's soul about being responsible within the globe.</p><p>Marya (protected by the unicorn) and Daniel argue; he feels she ran out on him, but she just wanted to grow up in the real world. The unicorn stabs Daniel after he slaps Marya. Daniels leaves.</p><p>Gwen wants Tim to help Auberon, but Tim gets worried once he realizes that he's Titania's husband. He tries, but can't figure out how to do it.  Then Titania shows up.  She is angry at having to deal with the humans, and at the mess Auberon has gotten himself into. She tries to get the globe from Tim, but it falls and breaks.  Titania is about to wreak terror on them all in revenge for his presumably-lost soul, but it turns out that it went back into his body after all.</p><p>Auberon feels that he has learned something from being among the mortals, and stops Titania.  He wants to start a new relationship with her, after only playing at love for centuries.  He also asks Tim and Titania if Tim is her son, and she admits that it is true, and that Tamlin is the father.</p><p>However, Auberon says that Tim has no fairy blood, and so cannot be Titania's son, although he does look like Tamlin.  Auberon and Titania leave, with Tim once more unsure of his parentage.

She tells him that she knows he heard what Molly said--that he could grow up to hurt her.  Circe had planned to use her magic to find his soul's animal spirit-form, and have him confront what evil it may have represented, thus saving Molly.  But, she found that he has no animal spirit form, he's the most human soul she has ever seen. Knowing that, she won't do anything to him.</p><p>But Tim, concerned for Molly, asks her to do something anyway.  She tattoos him.  He goes home, and when he uses magic to help out a neighborhood cat, and then talks smack to his tattoo, he drops in pain.

But, she takes a special interest in him because she can tell he hasn't always been a horse.</p><p>Tim is ready to leave the modeling agency, but Psyche, who has taken to her new gangsta role more seriously than Cupid, pulls a real gun on Leah.  She demands money.  Tim doesn't know what to do, since she'll be able shoot before he makes a magical gesture.</p><p>He decides to provoke her, ridiculing her ""fly girl"" thing.  She hits him, which gives him time to release his butterfly tattoo, returning her to her previous state (in which she had butterfly wings), where she is no longer angry.</p><p>The lady Titania sits in Faerie, pondering the current state Auberon is in, which is mysterious to her.  He seems more questioning and passionate.  Unknown to her, he is there, disguised again as Selwyn.</p><p>They hear Molly, building a tree house.  She is bored with being bored, and wants to actually do something, create something--activities that fairies have forgotten about.  After first making fun of her, the Queen's fairies see the fun, and join in with Molly in building the tree house.</p><p>The Queen is not amused, and begins to plan an ultimate curse for Molly.</p>",,,,,,,False,42770,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/38099-5239-42770-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",28,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55724/', 'id': 55724, 'name': 'Faerie', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/faerie/4020-55724/'}]","Rites of Passage, Part Two: This Is Not About Chocolate",[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6442/', 'id': 6442, 'name': 'Comicraft', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/comicraft/4040-6442/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-52301/', 'id': 52301, 'name': 'John Ney Rieber', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-ney-rieber/4040-52301/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-51057/', 'id': 51057, 'name': 'Julie Rottenberg', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julie-rottenberg/4040-51057/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21401/', 'id': 21401, 'name': 'Michael Wm Kaluta', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/michael-wm-kaluta/4040-21401/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40841/', 'id': 40841, 'name': 'Neil Gaiman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neil-gaiman/4040-40841/', 'role': 'other'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-24932/', 'id': 24932, 'name': 'Peter Gross', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/peter-gross/4040-24932/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-26773/', 'id': 26773, 'name': 'Richard Starkings', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/richard-starkings/4040-26773/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21184/', 'id': 21184, 'name': 'Sherilyn Van Valkenburgh', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sherilyn-van-valkenburgh/4040-21184/', 'role': 'colorist'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic-28-rites-of-passage-part-two-th/4000-42770/,,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/story_arc/4045-56051/', 'id': 56051, 'name': '""The Books of Magic"" Rites of Passage', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic-rites-of-passage/4045-56051/'}]",[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-5239/', 'id': 5239, 'name': 'The Books of Magic', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic/4050-5239/'}"

Molly is clearly unhappy about Tim, but he doesn't notice.</p><p>Another gargoyle comes up and sees that Jack is still watching.  This is a break in their ways, they are not supposed to get involved in the people they watch.  However, Jack knows that Tim is an Opener, and Molly is his Other (as was mentioned once a while ago), so if Molly leaves, the notably unbalanced and self-obsessed Tim may sink all of California in his anger.</p><p>The other gargoyle reports back to his group.

As he holds it, it gives him true visions of his home, where his dad is fixing it up in hope he comes back.  He sees Molly, who is happy, even if she also misses him.

Two owls fly by, one white and one black. The white one transforms to Tim, who Bill is strangely not at all shocked to see, and he greets the other as Yo-yo, Tim's owl that died back in the original mini-series (and which Tim re-created, although he hasn't been seen again).</p><p>They chat happily, and Bill remarks on how nice it was that Tim came back after only a week of being missing, in much better sorts than before. They are happily living with Holly, and not-so-happily with Cyril.</p><p>The conductor has arrived at the grave of Mary Elizabeth Hunter--Tim's mom. There, he eats a strawberry that grows from the vines that grow from Mary's grave. Gwendolyn, last seen when Tim left home before the <em>Rites of Passage</em> storyline, confronts him, and another woman who sits there eating the strawberries.</p><p>Tim, meanwhile, runs into Awn the Blink in the bowels of the house, who suddenly realizes that Tim is not really Tim, but a changeling, and Yo-yo is in fact the Wobbly. Using the Wobbly's powers to affect things that have been thrown away, they mold Awn anew, making him see the new Tim as his new master. Even the new Tim almost seems to believe he is the old Tim. Awn even promises to make Cyril like him.</p><p>Back at the cemetery, we see that the strawberries each contain an explicit, discrete memory of Mary's. When one eats the strawberry, one experiences what Mary experienced. (The strawberries are the result of the seeds Death gave Tim in issue 4). The old woman eats them because she is the mother of Jimmy, Tim's best childhood friend, who died back in issue 9 when he was transformed into a statue by Reverend Slaggingham (and who Tim tried to save in issues 23 and 25). She feels it is her right to eat the berries because they sometimes give her glimpses of Jimmy when he was alive, through Mary's memories.</p><p>Gwendolyn feels that the composer, however, has no right to eat them. He eats them to gain access to Mary's soulful experience of life, which is so much deeper than his own, in order to write music that is much better than he could otherwise--but in so doing, he robs Tim of the chance of ever experiencing those memories himself. Gwendolyn, instead, takes the berries and makes them into preserves, so that Tim may one day eat them.</p><p>The changeling Tim does seem happy to live his new life.

Tim characterizes her as the kind of person most people don't notice. He notes that she finally admitted that Cyril has some problems, and he is also going to be temporarily institutionalized.</p><p>Tim, finally free for the first time in a while, and haven given up his magic, goes skating, and runs across Leah's old box, where she was trapped for centuries before Tim finally let her out.</p><p>Tim is sucked in. Leah picks up the box and says that trapping Tim in was the cruelest and fairest punishment she could devise.</p><p>Tim finds himself on a square floor, inexplicably in the midst of a jungle, which is populated by small gliding mammals. He is unable to walk past the square.</p><p>Tim dreams of various enemies from the past, saying they could have saved his soul. He wakes to find nothing.</p><p>Seasons pass. He spends his time writing in the dust, trying to avoid insanity. EVen more time passes--years. He is an adult, and comes to terms with his confinement, to a degree. A seed falls onto his square from above, and begins to grow into a tree; Tim weeps for its presence.</p><p>Tim is now an old man, and the tree has grown huge. He ponders his inability to get along with others, the way he never got too close to people.</p><p>One of the small gliders climbs down the tree; one has never come down to the square before. Tim is joyous. It runs off, despite his promise not to hurt it. The ghosts from his dream come back, saying that now that he has made a promise he can keep, their spirits are free.</p><p>The jungle begins to burn. Tim tries to protect his one tree, and calls on his absent magic to do so, but only a single raindrop falls.</p><p>Leah shows up, and the fire ends. She says he gets so focused on little things, like the tree, that he misses the big things--like when she turned to an elemental to save him. She is angry that he never looked for her. She rejuvenates him to his youth, and explains that he is the one who made this place, and that he couldn't actually get rid of his magic, because his magic is him.</p><p>It should be noted that this event, in which Tim has aged--on the inside, even if his body is reverted--for at least decades, and gained peace and maturity, is rarely if ever brought up again. It is similarly notable for Leah's seemingly out of character desire to punish him (although it is true that Tim didn't look for her), especially since she is now ostensibly an ego-less elemental. Their relationship is not revisited.</p><p>A back-up feature, excerpting several pages from the next issue, is also included.

Titania is a habitue of the library, and loves its variety, but never learned to read true, physical books.</p><p>Lucien shows her a copy of the Books of Magic, about Tim's life, but it begins to burn in her hands, for someone in reality has begin to actually write it.  They do not know its author, but it is by Thomas Currie.</p><p>Currie explains that Openers, like Tim, create worlds.  When they are young, they do so by instinct, often when in pain or confusion: they create a world slightly different from their own, often related to the thing that caused the pain.  Their memory related to that incident also disappears, and a bit of their soul goes to the new world.</p><p>Currie says that Openers who are trained early on don't lose too much of their selves, but if they are not trained, they can lose their identity due to the missing pieces, and cause terrible problems.  He also says that an Opener must have, and meet, his Other--who earlier in the series was said to be Molly, and was implied to be the person who made the Opener feel whole through love, and create stability for him in that way.</p><p>We see a version of Tim from one of these other worlds, where he avoids the Trenchcoat Brigade and never learns magic.  At home, he finds a leather jacket and sunglasses-wearing version of himself, who have just carved up his mother and father with a knife.  This is the Other--a version of Tim who found out about his other selves, and is killing them one by one to gain their bit of magic, so that he can eventually confront the true Tim.</p><p>The Other stabs this world's Tim, explaining that almost all of the Tim's who had not lost their mother in the car crash don't take up magic.  The Other absorbs his natural ability.</p><p>The true Tim visits a book shop, and sells off his old fantasy books; he no longer feels connected to their made-up worlds.</p><p>Then he visits his mother's grave, and talks to her about recent events.  Titania suddenly appears, and says she will give him the Mundane Egg, first seen in the original miniseries, freely.  He doesn't trust her, and knocks the egg away, breaking it.  Titania explains that he has destroyed a potential world.  He likes the feeling of magic that envelops him from it.  She leaves in anger, saying that a storm is coming, and she won't help any more.</p><p>When she leaves, a lightning bolt falls down and splits his mother's grave, spilling her bones all over.  Tim is distraught, and tries to push them back in place.  As he does, he finds a necklace that she always wore.</p><p>This necklace is a Glamour Stone, which makes someone appear differently from their true appearance.  We see, although Tim does not, that his ""mother's"" skull is decidedly inhuman, with fangs.</p><p>Tim walks off with the necklace.</p><p>Thomas Currie, in the Inn Between, talks with a young woman, Joh.  He is leaving the Inn Between to find the true Tim, to warn him about the Other.  And if he believes that Tim cannot kill the Other, then Thomas will kill Tim, thus destroying all of his creations, including the Other, thus saving reality.</p>",,,,,,,False,45249,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9116/1011977-51.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",51,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55857/', 'id': 55857, 'name': 'The Dreaming', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-dreaming/4020-55857/'}]",A Thousand Worlds of Tim,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3714/', 'id': 3714, 'name': 'Cliff Chiang', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cliff-chiang/4040-3714/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6442/', 'id': 6442, 'name': 'Comicraft', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/comicraft/4040-6442/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1806/', 'id': 1806, 'name': 'Jamison', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jamison/4040-1806/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14862/', 'id': 14862, 'name': 'Jason Temujin Minor', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jason-temujin-minor/4040-14862/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21401/', 'id': 21401, 'name': 'Michael Wm Kaluta', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/michael-wm-kaluta/4040-21401/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-24932/', 'id': 24932, 'name': 'Peter Gross', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/peter-gross/4040-24932/', 'role': 'writer, penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21184/', 'id': 21184, 'name': 'Sherilyn Van Valkenburgh', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sherilyn-van-valkenburgh/4040-21184/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42338/', 'id': 42338, 'name': 'Stuart Moore', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/stuart-moore/4040-42338/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic-51-a-thousand-worlds-of-tim/4000-45249/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-50689/', 'id': 50689, 'name': 'Trenchcoat Brigade', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/trenchcoat-brigade/4060-50689/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-5239/', 'id': 5239, 'name': 'The Books of Magic', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic/4050-5239/'}"

The world ends in a blast of magic.</p><p>Tim's dad and his new wife Holly, and her son Cyril walk around the zoo, wondering where Tim has gotten to (Tim's time in Leah's box took no time in our world).  Apparently Holly and Cyril did not spend a lot of time getting therapy in America.</p><p>Thomas Currie has arrived in the true Tim's reality, and shows up at Tim's original home. His neighbors tell Currie that Bill married Holly recently, that his original wife, Mary, died years ago, and that they all moved away.</p><p>Bill finds Tim and tells him that they want to send him to Bardsey, a fancy boarding school; Holly will pay for it. Tim is very unhappy about this, especially when he learns that Cyril will be in the same grade. Bill knows it will be hard, so he tells him he can skip out of the rest of the family outing and go back to their original home to talk to his old friends about it.</p><p>As Tim travels there on the bus, he thinks that he feels even less at home than he did in the US or Faerie. He also wants to see Molly, but knows he can't. He wants to be normal.</p><p>Thomas goes to Faerie to get more help on his mission to stop the Other and warn Tim. He is concerned, because on other worlds, his late mother is usually very important in teaching Tim to use his magic wisely.</p><p>Currie traps a troll in a magic circle. He bargains with him to get his Glamour Stone; with it, he looks like a giant troll, but without it the troll is small. Now Currie can look like the troll.</p><p>Tim arrives home to find a sign that says it's for sale, which his dad had not told him. He is angry, and talks with his magical creation, In-the-No about it. In-the-No wants to be free of the neighborhood, where's Tim's magic traps him. Tim says he can't free him because he doesn't have magic any more; it tells him that it knows secrets about Molly. It also says that the other kids in the neighborhood only played with him because Jimmy made them, and that his body was eventually found in the ocean.</p><p>As Tim walks off, some of the toy plastic army men that he brought to life follow him.</p><p>Some of Molly's brothers find Tim. They angrily confront him, saying that he changed her, and that she went to live in Ireland. He fights back, and the army men take his side, shooting at the brothers.

Because of a misunderstanding of the term ""fairy,"" by which Davis means ""gay"" and Tim means ""Faerie,"" Tim agrees that Curry is a ""fairy"" and he might be one himself.

He and his creatures kill Molly and Tamlin, who had flown out to save her.</p><p>Various members of the group elect to defend the castle while Tim takes the time to cast a spell to protect them, but they fall one by one.  He casts the spell, but a bolt blasts it apart and wounds Currie.  The Other arrives; he believes this is the true Tim.  He kills him, and absorbs his magic, but realizes it is not the true Tim.  Currie, however, was protected enough by Tim's spell to survive when all the rest of the world is destroyed, and he escapes before the Other can kill him.  He then begins to go from world to world, looking for the true Tim.</p><p>Tim finishes reading the letter.  Currie tells him that he is a creation of Tim's, from a world that he created.

He calls up a version of the Wobbly to see if there is anything useful, and decides that Bill and Cyril are not.  He is interested to see Holly, whom he has never seen a version of before.</p><p>Holly, hallucinating, tells him a story:</p><p>Some time ago, she met her friend, Shirley Tinch.  She told her about meeting Bill for the first time, how she felt sorry for him in his bandages.  Her friend, however, is more interested in whether she talked with Lloyd, a man with whom she'd been having an affair.  She had planned to ask him to get married, since she's pregnant, but when she showed up at his house, she met his wife.</p><p>Shirley is a strong proponent of Holly standing up for herself, which she often does not do.  She plans to have an abortion, unlike what she did when pregnant with Cyril, which was also on her own.  However, unlike her friend, she is unable to live on her own.  After a flip remark, she decides to date the man she is least attracted to: Bill.</p><p>However, more events get in the way: Lloyd now wants to talk, and she fantastizes that they will get back together.  Shirley tries to be there for her friend, even though she knows she's making a mistake.</p><p>Holly does manage to end her relationship with Lloyd, but then meets Bill again, and thinks it will work because Bill really needs her.  Shirley can't take what she sees as another bad decision.  She makes a bet with Holly that it won't work with Bill, with their friendship being the wager.</p><p>Over time, Holly keeps writing Shirley letters and leaving messages on the phone, talking about the ups and downs of her life with Bill, Cyril, and Tim.  She wants to regain their friendship as well.  Shirley listens with some hope, but can see the writing on the wall as problems arise (mostly due to Tim, really, not Bill).  She is crushed by the fact that things turn out badly, as she knew they would.</p><p>We return to the present, and Holly dies--the second wife of Bill Hunter to do so in a car accident.

Auntie Blodwyn is also there, and her face is seen for the first time.  She confuses Holly with Molly, who she thought was the one they were there to mourn (Tim has not yet learned that Molly met the Other).</p><p>Tim talks to Davis, his friend from school, who tells him that he heard that Holly had not been paying the tuition bill, and that Tim and Cyril are going to be expelled.  Apparently Cyril knew, and was fixing the books so it looked like they were paid up.  Cyril may have been taking the money for himself.</p><p>Shirley Tinch, Holly's friend from last issue, shows up and talks with Bill, but Holly had never mentioned her to Bill.  They both feel her loss.</p><p>The next day, Tim passes by his original house, but almost misses it until Thomas Currie calls him back.  He has covered it with wards so magical and normal sight can't see it easily.  Currie has turned the house into a vacuum that is sucking up the remains of Tim's old magic.</p><p>He explains that magic is a truth, and truth depends on one's perspective. So even though Tim did give away his magic, simultaneously he cannot give it away because it is him, and one day he will be able to reclaim the magic that is collected in the house.</p><p>Bill goes to talk to a lawyer about Holly's estate.  He is horrified to hear that not only does no one know who Cyril's father was--because Bill would optimally not like to keep him--but that Holly had almost no money and her insurance policy was paid to Lloyd, the man she had an affair with as described in last issue.</p><p>Bill does tell Cyril that they will all stay together, and the kids will stay at Bardsey, because he doesn't know about the tuition problems.  Bill is once again despondent as he was when Mary died.  Tim doesn't want to break the truth to him so he says that Cyril should stay home for relaxation's sake.</p><p>Thomas turns the Hunter's old TV into a scrying device so they can see the other worlds, but none of them are showing up on the channels.  Tim asks why he can't take his magic back now, and Thomas says it would kill him; he needs to learn the skills of magic now, instead of doing it by instinct.</p><p>Thomas says they are in a hurry, because Tim must become good enough to learn to use magic fully before the Other arrives--which he thinks may be years from now.</p><p>Bill finally hears about the tuition from a phone message.  He sits in a chair in dismay, as he did all the time while Tim was growing up.  He tests Tim on this when he gets home--he asks Tim how school was, knowing he wasn't there, and is disappointed when Tim lies and says he was.  Bill decides he has failed Tim, but won't fail Cyril.  He does manage to not drink any alcohol.  However, when he wakes up the next day, his magic arm, gained from demons, has fallen off.</p><p>Thomas realizes that the TV is working--there simply are no other worlds any more.  He knows the Other has arrived.</p><p>In the back-up story, a long time ago, Dymphna and Bridey await the return of the boy Auberon in Faerie.  He brings a strange creature home.  They decide it could be safe, and he names it Gyvv.  That night, the women forget to put their traditional spell of protection on Auberon, and evil creatures show up at his window.</p><p>Gyvv, however, defeats them.</p><p>In the morning, Dymphna and Bridey realize that they forgot to put on the spell, and rush in fear to his room.  They find him sleeping peacefully, but also find evidence of wood goblins.

However, he also finds his father, who last issue woke up with his magic arm fallen off.  He has gotten drunk.  At first Tim thinks it's because of Holly's death, but then he sees that his dad had bandaged the arm to his body.  When he takes the bandages off, the arm falls off again,then turns to dust.  Tim runs off to get help.</p><p>Tim gets him to the hospital, but when they hear about the arm, and that his face was also healed of major burns by Vasuki, they think it's all a delusion on Bill's part.

Tim refuses.  However, Thoimas drugged the tea.</p><p>Tim passes out.  Thomas, in his diaries, writes at how displeased he is with Tim.

Thomas will act without him.</p><p>When Tim wakes up, he sees Molly's letter and reads it, realizing that Molly wrote it thinking that the Other was Tim.  Tim refuses to let Molly be hurt by the Other.  He goes to the room where his magic is kept, and takes it back, saying (more maturely than normal) that magic requires sacrifice.</p><p>Thomas goes to Bill's hospital room.  Bill wakes up, and worries that he scared Tim.  Thomas hypnotizes him, and either has him jump out the window, or throws him out.  Bill is, after years of unhappiness, dead.

He finds a man there, who lets him in and says he himself can now leave.  He says Tim is the storm, and that he is not ready for what he will find.  Tim says he can't wait, because his father needs him (not knowing he is dead).</p><p>Inside, he finds a spider with a woman's head, who calls herself one of ""We Who Wat."" She says Tim will come to this tower 5 times, and asks what he wants.  He wants his power, and she says that while his magic is everywhere, his power is below.  The floor falls out into an abyss, and as he falls, she says he must name the place he is.</p><p>Back in the real world, Thomas Currie finds Tim in a semi-conscious state, hung by wires to the magical machine that contains his magic; Tim is being drowned by the immensity of his magic.

When young mage Tim Hunter is kidnapped by mystically-inclined gangsters, he learns of an ancient power operating at the heart of London's underworld.</i></p><p>Two men are collecting money for a local mobster. One, Julian, is a sorcerer, but the other, Edward, doesn't really see what he does, so he is annoyed and trying to prove he's better than this.  The sorcerer thinks it's odd that the boss likes to get paid in both money and flowers.</p><p>They pass by Tim, and the magician recognizes him.  He wants to see if he can be made to work with them.  Tim brushes off their interest, but then Julian threatens Tim's Aunt Blodwyn, who lives in the town.</p><p>Tim agrees to go with them. Julian explains how he uses magic to make money illegally; Tim is unimpressed with his knowledge. They meet the crime boss, Mr. Robbins.  Tim recognizes that the man is actually Robin Goodfellow, or Puck.</p><p>Robbins lets the others out of the room and transforms into his faerie self.  He wants to know what Tim's doing there, thinking he's trying to reveal him, but Tim explains that he was just forced to come.  Robbins explains that he doesn't need more magicians, he is happy enough with normal human debauchery and degradation.</p><p>Robbins wants to kill Tim to keep his secret, but Tim makes a pact that he'll forget about Robbins if Robbins leaves him alone.  Robbins agrees, but wants to punish Julian for causing the situation, and says Tim must help.</p><p>They go out in the country, and Robbins tests Julian by saying he needs to open an ancient faerie doorway there.  Julian is completely not up to the test and can't do it.</p><p>Tim also believes he can't do it, but when he randomly gestures at it, it opens.  Julian is pulled through the gate.

Shut off from everyone and everything he knows, Tim slips through a magical rift and meets a strange group of travelers trying desperately to find their way home. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the realms, a powerful mythic force called the Wild Hunt is stirring back to life after a long absence. </i></p><p>The issue begins, unusually, with a summing-up page.</p><p>Tim is stuck in a storm outside, and is predictably unhappy with his choices and luck.  He lost most of his belongings to Cyril, who took his pack. He puts on his mother's necklace, which turns out to indeed be a glamour stone, which makes him look like a younger version of his mother.</p><p>With the stone on, he accesses the Sight even more easily, and notices that the storm is in fact a Storm of Magic.  He sees that there is a path that is dry, and takes it, knowing that it will likely lead to more adventures.  He keeps the stone on, and remains looking like a teenage girl for much of the next several issues.</p><p>He sees many other magical creatures running from the storm, but they seem to not see the path.  One small creature, who turns out to be a lost dream, falls in the path and joins Tim. They see a stagecoach riding by, and try to get a ride, but it doesn't stop.</p><p>A girl, Joh, who we last saw in issue 51, explains that the coach is for the dead.  She introduces herself, and says she is trying to get back to her boss, Accasbel, and the Inn Between.  She's lost because of the increasingly-bad storms.  Tim introduces himself as Mary.</p><p>Joh has been collecting creatures from destroyed realms, or those who are lost, including the dancing bear in a tutu that has been seen in the background of many issues (Julie); Hugh, a monk who escaped hell; and Rosehip the flitling.</p><p>Hugh was a monk who killed himself so he could convert the heathens of hell.  The storm has even opened the gates of hell, and he took that chance to leave.</p><p>Henry Lywood, a boy with a rocket pack, also joins them.  They keep walking, but are concerned that they may be in the land of the dead.  They enter an orchard; Tim warns them not to eat anything, or they will be stuck there.  Then they come to a chasm; the land of the living is on the other side.</p><p>Henry tries to fly to the other side with a rope so they can get across, but crashes and explodes after he lands.  He did get the rope across though, so they start to traverse the chasm.  Before Tim crosses, he sees Henry, back on the dead side.  He explains that he thinks he was already dead, and also ate some of the berries.</p><p>The dream is stuck halfway across the rope, and needs ""Mary's"" help to get across.  She tells the dream that it belonged to Tim, and represented his fears, but Tim is no longer there; ""he"" has accepted his new identity as Mary.  In the process, he loses the dream, and thus his fear of failure.</p><p>In a different realm, called Bar Equall, the people fight the storm as well.  They are trying to keep their food stores safe, but then they find that the gates to other realms are open for the first time in 2000 years.  They turn out to be the members of the Wild Hunt, and the Lord of the Hunt, regaining his hidden helmet, tells them to ride through the rest of the realms, where they have been banned by the Compact for millennia.</p>",,,,,,,False,46641,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/41331-5239-46641-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",64,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-42471/', 'id': 42471, 'name': 'Hell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hell/4020-42471/'}]",Heart of the Storm,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3714/', 'id': 3714, 'name': 'Cliff Chiang', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cliff-chiang/4040-3714/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6442/', 'id': 6442, 'name': 'Comicraft', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/comicraft/4040-6442/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1806/', 'id': 1806, 'name': 'Jamison', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jamison/4040-1806/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21401/', 'id': 21401, 'name': 'Michael Wm Kaluta', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/michael-wm-kaluta/4040-21401/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-24932/', 'id': 24932, 'name': 'Peter Gross', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/peter-gross/4040-24932/', 'role': 'writer, artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21184/', 'id': 21184, 'name': 'Sherilyn Van Valkenburgh', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sherilyn-van-valkenburgh/4040-21184/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42338/', 'id': 42338, 'name': 'Stuart Moore', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/stuart-moore/4040-42338/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic-64-heart-of-the-storm/4000-46641/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-54294/', 'id': 54294, 'name': 'The Wild Hunt', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-wild-hunt/4060-54294/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-5239/', 'id': 5239, 'name': 'The Books of Magic', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic/4050-5239/'}"

However, instead of killing him, they want him to make them new weapons.

As they walk to her home, we see many other coffins in the woods.</p><p>Her mother is trying to put an adult man's body back in a coffin as they arrive.

In this jumping-on point story, young mage Tim Hunter, disguised as a kitchen girl at the Inn Between Worlds, experiences identity crises, ghosts, faeries, and a visit from a long-lost loved one. But at the Inn Between, things are rarely what they seem. </i></p><p>Tim, wearing a glamour stone to appear as his mother, as going under her name, Mary, thinks of all the realms he's visited, and how they are all in tumult, because a magical storm has torn through all the realms and opened their gates, so everyone can travel anywhere. All the lords of the realms are losing control over their now-free people.</p><p>Tim/Mary is in the Inn Between Worlds, one of four Free Houses that are independent and safe for everyone. He works there with Joh for Accasbel, among all the crazy beings that have come for refuge. Accasbel is frustrated with freeloaders who try to hide in the tavern so they don't have to pay, and throws out a demon for that reason. They can all stay in the tavern during the day, but not at night.</p><p>It is ""Mary's"" day off, so she goes for a wash. On the way she finds a group of dead souls, who very often these days can't find the land of the dead. She points them on.</p><p>She goes to a pool, and as she's alone, takes off the stone so she can be Tim again. He is afraid he is losing his identity, being on the run, in a different realm, in an assumed form. As he swims, Tamlin (who died way, way back in issue 4) suddenly appears. He is excited to be with his son. Tim questions him about how he's alive, but Tamlin says he has been looking all over for him. They go to the Inn together, with Tim now in his true form, which no one recognizes.</p><p>They see Joh, who seems to recognize Tim, and gives them a free pint. They also talk to the demon Puzzlestick, who keeps trying to get enough money to stay the night, but refuse his gesture of telling a story.</p><p>Puzzlestick goes on to talk to some women. After they refuse him, he tells them that they are all dreams of old lovers. Tamlin finds a coin and gives it to Puzzlestick so he stops bothering the women. Tim realizes that Tamlin is a dream, like the women, and leaves.</p><p>Tim runs into some faeries who are trying to hide. Titania is coming, and did not give them permission to leave Faerie. Titania comes in the Inn, looking for her subjects. She has no power here as a queen, however, since it is a Free House. Tim puts on the stone again so she won't recognize him. Tim, as Mary, runs into Joh. She is excited to share the fact that she just saw Tim, who she is in love with, and has a photo of!</p>",,,,,,,False,46643,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/41333-5239-46643-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",66,[],"A Day, A Night, & A Dream: Part One",[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7866/', 'id': 7866, 'name': 'Charles Vess', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/charles-vess/4040-7866/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3714/', 'id': 3714, 'name': 'Cliff Chiang', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cliff-chiang/4040-3714/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6442/', 'id': 6442, 'name': 'Comicraft', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/comicraft/4040-6442/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1806/', 'id': 1806, 'name': 'Jamison', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jamison/4040-1806/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-24932/', 'id': 24932, 'name': 'Peter Gross', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/peter-gross/4040-24932/', 'role': 'writer, artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21184/', 'id': 21184, 'name': 'Sherilyn Van Valkenburgh', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sherilyn-van-valkenburgh/4040-21184/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42338/', 'id': 42338, 'name': 'Stuart Moore', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/stuart-moore/4040-42338/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic-66-a-day-a-night-a-dream-part-o/4000-46643/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-5239/', 'id': 5239, 'name': 'The Books of Magic', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic/4050-5239/'}"

They go down into the caverns below the school and find Cyril; even his glamour stone can't hide him from the helmet.  Cyril says he traded the magic to Barbatos for his resurrection kettle; his resurrected mother, Holly, walks up.</p><p>Tim is angered, and disgusted, since there are clearly sexual overtones in the way Cyril treats his mother's living body.

However, the Hunt quickly catches up.</p><p>Tim grabs Barbatos and ties him to a cross, the bargains with him for his old power.  He knows he needs more than just his old bottle of power to beat the Other, who has the power of all the Tims from alternate dimensions.  Barbatos agrees, but says the price is a memory--which Tim knows would lead him down the dark path to being Sir Timothy.</p><p>But Tim has no choice, and agrees.</p><p>Tim thanks Lasas for her help (he doesn't know she is Auberon).  Then he says he must leave the Hunt. Cupid explains that no one can leave without losing a Challenge.  He asks Lasas to challenge him, but she says no, and kisses him on the mouth.

Following last issue's climactic confrontation among Tim, the Other and Barbatos, we jump 30 years into the future to see the consequences of Tim Hunter's actions. By selling one of his memories to the demon Barbatos, Tim lost his own soul, but now Barbatos finds himself possessed, as Tim fights back with a secret plan of his own. This issue wraps up all the plotlines from the first volume of THE BOOKS OF MAGIC, setting the stage for the next chapter in Tim's life, his fantastic quest to become the greatest mage on earth. Tim returns later this year in a miniseries that finds Tim with new allies and enemies as he pursues his destiny, setting the stage for a whole new direction in a new regular series.</p><p>Some workers in the Dreaming find Barbatos (the one from the future), still locked in the giant armored hand 40 years from now. They free him and send him to Hell.</p><p>Barbatos demands entrance, based on his previous role as an archduke, and is let in. He finds that Hauptman has taken his place, and that he is considered a joke. He is kicked out, and randomly helps another demon. This kindness is considered heretical, and he is caught and examined. They believe he is possessed by a human soul, and needs to go to heaven. Before they can take him, he remembers his time-travel hourglass, and goes back to the time when Tim beat the Opener.</p><p>Tim can now talk to Barbatos. Barbatos plans to stop his original self from taking Tim's memory, which is how he got possessed. Tim explains that when he gave Barbatos his memory, he secretly gave him his soul as well. The whole time that Barbatos was manipulating Sir Timothy, Tim was manipulating Barbatos. That way Tim's old body could die without his soul in it.</p><p>Barbatostries to force his way into the Other's mansion, but his puppet underlings grab him. They want to stop Barbatos because they want to be put out of their misery.</p><p>Events unfold as they did before (in issue 74). Then Tim uses his power to reshape Barbatos's body into his own original body, so he can live a normal life starting at the same point that his other self starts living in slavery.</p><p>Joh finds her way back to the Inn Between Worlds, and finds Accasbel alive. He says that he and Drunk both survived, and that Joh and Accasebl can now start over again.</p><p>Various characters from the series, including Tim's dad, Reverend Slaggingham, the waitress from the Arcana annual and issue 26, Circe, and Marya walk around in London, with a waft of magic passing them by. We see Cupid happy as the Lord of the Hunt, Auberon and Titania still suspicious, and Cyril using his glamour stone to look like Tim, then, in a nod to the oft-commented-to-be-similar Harry Potter series, runs through the train station at platform nine and three quarters.</p><p>Mary Hunter's grave is seen to be once again clean and put to rest; Molly plays with Tim's creatures. Leah looks down on them from a cosmic perch.</p><p>Tim, having created himself a new body, says that he doesn't know what he's going to do, but he will be the one to decide, and he will take responsibility for it.</p>",,,,,,,False,46652,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/41342-5239-46652-1-books-of-magic-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",75,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-42471/', 'id': 42471, 'name': 'Hell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hell/4020-42471/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55857/', 'id': 55857, 'name': 'The Dreaming', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-dreaming/4020-55857/'}]","The Closing, Part Three: Inner Child","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57896/', 'id': 57896, 'name': 'Books of Magic', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/books-of-magic/4055-57896/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-60867/', 'id': 60867, 'name': 'Barbara Schulz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/barbara-schulz/4040-60867/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6442/', 'id': 6442, 'name': 'Comicraft', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/comicraft/4040-6442/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-51262/', 'id': 51262, 'name': 'Heidi MacDonald', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heidi-macdonald/4040-51262/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1806/', 'id': 1806, 'name': 'Jamison', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jamison/4040-1806/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21401/', 'id': 21401, 'name': 'Michael Wm Kaluta', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/michael-wm-kaluta/4040-21401/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-24932/', 'id': 24932, 'name': 'Peter Gross', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/peter-gross/4040-24932/', 'role': 'writer, artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48997/', 'id': 48997, 'name': 'Ryan Kelly', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ryan-kelly/4040-48997/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21184/', 'id': 21184, 'name': 'Sherilyn Van Valkenburgh', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sherilyn-van-valkenburgh/4040-21184/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42327/', 'id': 42327, 'name': 'Will Dennis', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/will-dennis/4040-42327/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic-75-the-closing-part-three-inner/4000-46652/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-5239/', 'id': 5239, 'name': 'The Books of Magic', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-books-of-magic/4050-5239/'}"

The mermaid doesn't understand why they can't control their magic and their reliance on words, while they are not sure they can trust her, as an elemental.  She is from a Tower, but at least not the Dark Tower. The mermaid splashes them, and they all disappear from the real world, and Tim and the mermaid reappear in her tower of the Moon, a vast unending space of water.</p><p>The mermaid continues to talk to him cryptically about how words are empty, then swims away, testing his understanding.

The kids in the area used to keep her alive with their imaginations, but now the movie keeps them away.
