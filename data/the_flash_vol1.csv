Allen's thoughts are lost on his latest adventure, as the Flash. Under the ruse of measuring his top speed for science, the Flash had allowed himself to be bombarded with a strange radiation, that actually forced him to run. The scientist, who had tricked the Flash, revealed himself to be an alien, Kee Felig of the planet, Mohru. Held in place by the radiation beam, the Flash was forced to run, ever faster, until he would eventually perish. Unbeknownst to the Flash, law enforcement authorities on Mohru were having trouble with lightning-fast thieves.</p><p>His every attempt to slow down a failure, the Flash switched tactics by actually increasing his speed. Exceeding the speed of light, the Flash was able to break free of the radiation beam that held him. The Flash's scientific curiosity is drawn to a piece of fulgurite. As the Flash leaned down to collect the Fulgurite, it suddenly disappeared. Investigating further, the Flash learned that several museums, across the country, had reported fulgurite thefts. At one such museum, the Flash witnessed another piece suddenly float away at enormous speed. Matching it's velocity, the Flash saw another speedster carrying the fulgurite away.</p><p>The speedster raced into the side of a hill, and vanished. The Flash saw another speedster do the exact same thing. Continuing the pursuit, the Flash raced into the hillside, and found himself breaking the dimensional barrier between Earth and Mohru. Recognizing Kee Felig among the alien speedsters, the Flash took them all down, then turned them over to the authorities. The Flash learned that the aliens were taking any object struck by lightning on Earth, to Mohru. There they drew out the essence of the lightning to give themselves super-speed. As the Flash was the sole being, on either world, who could possibly stop them, they attempted to take him out.</p><p> </p><p><u><i>The Super-Gorilla's Secret Identity!</i></u></p><p><i>The strangest army imaginable was poised to strike a shattering blow at the Earth!

The photographer takes his first picture, of Scudder behind bars, only to see Scudder vanish with the fading of the flash bulb. Once the picture has been developed, West, and the photographer, are startled to see a three foot tall Scudder in the cell. Using his mastery of mirrors, Scudder effected his escape by reducing himself in size. As Scudder dons his Mirror Master costume, he reflects on his accidental discovery of his way with mirrors.</p><p>Cloaking himself in intense reflected light, the Mirror Master robs a local bank. The Flash confronts the Mirror Master. Instantly, the Flash is blinded by the Mirror Master's glowing aura.Though the Mirror Master escapes, the Flash is able to recover the stolen loot. The incident with the Mirror Master has made the Flash late for a date with West. Arriving at her office, the Flash, as police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, finds a break-up note from West. She's waited for him for the last time. Spying a blinding light emanating from a nearby rooftop, Allen investigates, as the Flash.</p><p>The Flash discovers a giant mirror on the rooftop, reflecting light onto the street. This mirror, though, is merely a decoy. The Mirror Master ambushes the Flash with a mirror that miniaturizes the Flash. The Mirror Master lunges for the tiny speedster, only to cause the Flash to fall off the roof. Landing safely on the street below, the Flash takes time out to push a pedestrian out of traffic, before returning to his laboratory, at police headquarters. Using an experimental Polaroid Light Machine, the Flash is able to restore himself to his normal height.</p><p>The Flash catches up with the Mirror Master at the same bank he robbed earlier, and apprehends his old foe. Using one of the Mirror Master's special mirrors, the Flash, as Allen, projects images of himself everywhere West goes. Feeling haunted by her memories of Allen, West calls him and gives him one more chance at a romantic relationship with her. On his way to their date, Allen slips on the mirror, knocking himself unconscious for thirty minutes.

The lecturer is Doctor Wiley Summers, one of Allen's college colleagues. Summers' lecture concerns a fantastic experience he had, while examining Mount Lassen, the only active volcano in the continental United States. Summers became aware of strange cloud formations directly over his head, that exuded an air of menace. Summers quickly photographed the clouds. Upon developing the film, though, the clouds seemed quite ordinary. Summers theorized that these cloud ""creatures"" dwelled within the volcano, and were intent on wiping out humanity.</p><p>With no real evidence to support his wild claims, the scientific community, rightly, considered the idea to be ludicrous. Summers, thus, raises the alarm, to the public, through his lecture tour. After the lecture, Allen introduces West to Summers. West, though, also considers Summer's notion preposterous. Having failed to wipe out humanity through volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, the hostile clouds mount an attack on an army base, revealing themselves to the world. After destroying the military installation with a barrage of lightning, the clouds turn towards civilian targets. The deafening sound of their thunder is such that it can reduce buildings to rubble.</p><p>Every countermeasure brought to bear against the clouds harmlessly passes right through them. Leaving West behind with Summers, Allen heads out to meet the threat, as the Flash. Dodging the cloud's lightning barrage, the Flash runs in a tight circle, generating a tornado. The clouds easily avoid the Flash's attack, simply by increasing their elevation. The clouds generate a powerful vacuum, lifting a building from it's foundations. Once released, the building crashes to the Earth, destroying it. The Flash races up a high hill, then leaps into the clouds. Moving at incredible velocity, the Flash is able to, literally, skip across the cloud formations in the sky.</p><p>Noticing a dark spot on each of the hostile clouds, the Flash surmises that it must be their nerve center, and aims for it. The Flash manages to destroy all but one of the deadly clouds, before he is caught in the last cloud's vacuum beam. Moving even faster, the Flash manages to break loose and destroy the final cloud. Still moving at phenomenal velocity, the Flash is able to virtually walk on the air itself, lowering himself safely to the ground. A sudden downpour signals the end of the bizarre cloud creatures, as, in death, they have become rain. Allen invites West out on another date, only to learn that she has already agreed to go out with Summers. It seems Allen has a rival for West's affections.</p><h3><ins>The Challenge Of The Crimson Crows!</ins></h3><p>Wally West wakes up from an incredible dream. In the dream, West met his idol, the Flash. A laboratory accident gave West the same powers as the Flash. West was given a ring with his costume in it, then given the code name ""Kid Flash"".  Having overslept, West misses the school bus, and is forced to run all the way to school. To his amazement West arrives before the late bell has finished ringing. The dream was really a memory. As further proof of his amazing super-speed abilities, West easily outperforms his fellow basketball players, in an after school game.</p><p>On the way home, West encounters a few of his friends, who have joined a gang, called the Crimson Crows. Though offered a place in their ranks, West has declined. Fearing the Crimson Crows may get up to trouble, West, as Kid Flash, sneaks into their clubhouse. Moving faster than the eye can see, Kid Flash eavesdrops on the Crimson Crows' plan to attack a rival gang, the Golden Eagles. Kid Flash surreptitiously follows the Crimson Crows, and watches as they throw stones at the Golden Eagles' clubhouse. In their haste to race out and face their rivals, a candle is tipped over in their clubhouse, setting it afire.</p><p>The flames quickly spread, igniting the nearby woods. Moving at super-speed, Kid Flash sets up a firebreak. Then, the fastest boy alive begins to run around the burning trees, creating a vacuum that smothers the fire. Feeling guilty for their role in the fire, the Crimson Crows turn their gang into an athletic group. West, fulfilling his promise to keep the Flash informed of his adventures, races a letter to Allen's house, detailing his latest case. Reading the letter, the Flash becomes certain that West is the right boy to be his protege.</p>",,,,,,,False,4702,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4259148-111.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",111,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Invasion of the Cloud Creatures! / Kid Flash: The Challenge of the Crimson Crows!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-111-invasion-of-the-cloud-creatures-kid-/4000-4702/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

As an adult, Dibny traveled the country seeking out India Rubber Men at every sideshow, circus, and fair. None would reveal the tricks of their trade. Despondent, Dibny suddenly remembered that all the India Rubber Men he met were fond of a soft drink called Gingold. Dibny researched the Gingold, learning that it was flavored with the juice of a rare tropical fruit. Dibny chemically drew the essence of the fruit into a liquid compound that he then consumed. To Dibny's dismay, nothing happened. Wandering the street, Dibny noticed a flower pot falling towards him. Instinctively he raised his arm to shield himself, only to find the limb stretching out to grasp the flower pot. The Gingold extract had given him the ability to elongate his entire body, an ability he decided to use to help people.</p><p>Jealous over all the media attention the Elongated Man has been receiving. Allen wonders if the Elongated Man might, in fact, be responsible for a series of robberies. At that moment, Allen's girlfriend, reporter Iris West, calls to inform him that the Elongated Man may beat out the Flash for Central City's ""Man Of The Year"" award. Allen changes into his Flash costume and sets out to prove that the Elongated Man is actually a crook.  The Flash convinces an Asian import company to display their collection of priceless vases at a nearby exhibition hall. Personally guaranteeing the safety of the vases, the Flash begins a security sweep of the hall. Suddenly, the owner of the import company bursts into the hall, and informs the Flash that the vases have been stolen from the warehouse they were stored in.</p><p>The Flash races to the scene of the crime, to find the Elongated Man exiting the warehouse. The Flash quickly nabs the Elongated Man, who reveals that he did, indeed, take the vases, to move them to a secure location. When the real thieves arrived to steal the vases, the Elongated Man took them down. The Elongated Man was on his way to inform the police, when the Flash captured him. Recognizing the criminal gang, the Flash notices that their ringleader, notorious criminal Perry Veto, isn't among them. The Elongated Man reveals that one man got away from him. The Flash tracks Veto by tire marks, left on the road in Veto's haste. Disabling Veto's car, the Flash ushers Veto to jail. At the ""Man Of The Year"" banquet, the Flash and The Elongated Man share the honor.</p><h3><ins>Danger On Wheels!</ins></h3><p>Schoolteacher, Linda Grant, informs her students that they will be attending school in a new building next year. Picking up on Grant's subtle distress, young Wally West lingers after class, and sees Grant crying. At West's inquiry, Grant reveals that her boyfriend, youth adviser Ralph Parker, lost the bid on the construction job for the new school. West visits the construction site of the new school, and sees two thugs beating up Parker. West changes into his Kid Flash costume, faster than the eye can see, and chases the thugs away.</p><p>At first, Parker believes he was assaulted for concerns he had raised regarding motorized ""Go-Mobiles"" being sold to children. Kid Flash reveals that he, himself, recently rescued two boys in Go-Mobiles who had crashed into one another. Parker and Kid Flash wander over to the Go-Mobile store, only to find that the agency has left Blue Valley. Parker surmises that the thugs may have been working for the Big Ace Construction Company. Parker had come to the new school's construction site to learn the methods by which Big Ace Construction could afford to build the new school so cheaply, and so quickly.</p><p>Suspecting that Big Ace Construction may be using substandard materials, Kid Flash puts the floors and gym equipment through the equivalent of a year's worth of wear and tear in a matter of seconds. Sure enough, the building materials prove to be shoddy. Big Ace Construction's swindling scheme revealed, the two thugs return and corner Parker and Kid Flash. The Fastest Boy On Earth easily takes down the two goons. Parker is awarded the building contract. With the help of the students, and Kid Flash, Parker is on schedule for completing the new school in time for classes in the Fall.</p>",,,,,,,False,4771,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4259149-112.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",112,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Mystery of the Elongated Man! / Danger on Wheels!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55822/', 'id': 55822, 'name': 'Gingold', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gingold/4055-55822/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-112-mystery-of-the-elongated-man-danger-/4000-4771/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Allen waits out in the car, giving him the chance to change into his Flash costume. Moving at super-speed, the Flash reaches the parole board, before West. The Flash, and West, are both there to offer testimony to bar the release of inmate Leonard Snart, the notorious Captain Cold. The Flash's testimony sways the board, who deny Snart an early release. The Flash tells West that he has business with a few other inmates, then quickly doffs his costume and returns to the car, where West finds Allen waiting for her. His parole denied, Snart moves forward with his plan for escape.</p><p>Using a tiny refrigeration device, cobbled together during his long months of incarceration, Snart freezes the bars on the window. Brittle from the cold, the bars are easily shattered. Snart is spotted crossing the prison yard, but quickly freezes the two penal officers solid. Luring the Flash out of state with a phony report of his whereabouts, Snart, as Captain Cold, calls on West. Captain Cold professes his love for West, then proposes marriage. When West refuses, Captain Cold activates a pulse device on his belt that freezes every living thing in Central City. West is given an ultimatum. Marry Captain Cold, or else Central City will stay frozen forever.</p><p>The Flash returns, and manages to gain entry through the ice sheaf covering Central City, by vibrating like a drill. Captain Cold ices up the road in front of the Flash, to buy himself time to mount a better offensive. Suddenly, the Flash sees a giant insect looming before him. Remembering Captain Cold's ability to cast illusions, the Flash races right through the horrific mirage. A massive flow of ice closes on the Flash. Believing it to be another illusory attack, the Flash runs right into it, encasing himself in ice. Vibrating at super-speed, the Flash is able to dig a channel out in the ice, and escape. Before Captain Cold can mount another attack, the Flash buffets him with high-velocity winds, rendering Captain Cold unconscious. Reversing the thermometer-like controls on Captain Cold's belt instantly thaws out Central City.</p><h3><ins>King Of The Beatniks!</ins></h3><p>Schoolteacher Linda Grant informs Principal Mason that she falsely accused honor student, James King, of cheating. By the time Grant realizes her mistake, King has runaway from home. Calling on King's friend, Wally West, Grant inquires as to King's whereabouts. West doesn't know, but he intends to find out, as Kid Flash. Recalling that King had a cousin, Paul, in York City, Kid Flash begins his search there. While scouring the city, Kid Flash spies a window washer falling from his scaffolding. Kid Flash empties a moving truck of it's blankets, and piles them underneath the window washer, breaking his fall.</p><p>Kid Flash locates King in a rundown tenement building, being held against his will. It turns out that King's cousin, Paul, is the self-styled ""King of The Beatniks"". Paul, and his associates are really a gang of thieves, masquerading as beatniks, to throw the police off their trail. When King refuses to join his cousin in criminal activities, the boy is locked up in their abode. Moving so fast he is invisible to the naked eye, Kid Flash eavesdrops on the Beatniks to learn their plans. Kid Flash follows the Beatniks out to Brown's Furs. Still moving too fast to be seen, Kid Flash returns the stolen furs back to the warehouse, as fast as the thieves can load them into their truck.</p><p>Kid Flash, though, is felled when one of the thieves accidentally swings open the warehouse door. Knocked unconscious by the heavy door, Kid Flash instantly revives at the sound of gunfire. So fast is Kid Flash, he is able to dodge the gunshot that jarred him back to consciousness.

The object is an exact miniature replica of Central City, complete with population. Using the replica, Elider's student's can observe Central City's inhabitants without ever leaving the school. Once a year, Elider bridges the gap between dimensions to record another replica of Central City. On his last trip, he was observed by the Flash. Suspicious of an extra-dimensional being carrying a miniature replica of Central City, in a glass case, the Flash chased after Elider.</p><p>The alien instructor was able to escape by simply phasing back into his dimension. Elider's students become fascinated with the Flash, taking great joy in observing his exploits. Through their observation they discover the Flash's secret identity, that of police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. They also spy on Allen's girlfriend, reporter Iris West. Knowing their idol can never know of their existence, the student body resign themselves to being the Flash's secret fans. Due to an irregularity in the technology used to record the replica, the student's are actually viewing events one hour into Central City's future.</p><p>A fact not lost on Elider's laboratory assistant, Modrie. Using his future knowledge of the stock market, and horse races, Modrie becomes a wealthy man on Earth. Tired of constantly traveling back and forth between dimensions, Modrie secretly sets up a feed from the recorder, that broadcasts the signal to Earth. Assuming the identity of ""M. Odriex"", Modrie establishes himself as the wealthiest man in Central City. His newfound status attracts the attention of the Internal Revenue Service. Modrie refuses to pay his taxes, and gains a measure of celebrity for his continued defiance.</p><p>The Flash decides to investigate, only to be stooped by Elider. In a huge breach of protocol, Elider reveals the existence of his people to the Flash. Furthermore, Elider has come to warn the Flash that his student's have just witnessed the Scarlet Speedster's death, gunned down by Modrie. Knowing he can't change the future, the Flash, nonetheless, heads off to confront ""M. Odriex"". Increasing his speed, the Flash moves faster than the eye can see, leaving an after-image of himself in his wake. Invisible, the Flash races into ""M. Odriex's"" home, and tampers with the villains revolver.</p><p>Catching up with his after-image before it has faded away, the Flash is prepared for his meeting with fate. Holding to history, the Flash allows ""M. Odriex"" to shoot him, then falls to the ground, seemingly dead. Moments later, the Flash springs back up, and ushers ""M. Odriex"" to the nearest police station. Modrie attempts to convince the authorities that, as an extra-dimensional being, they have no jurisdiction over him, but his pleas fall on deaf years. ""M. Odriex"" serves a long sentence for tax evasion. Elider seals the dimensional gateway between his world and the Flash's forever. The students. though, can still thrill to the Flash's adventures, for the rest of the year, by observing the replica.</p><h3><u>The Race To Thunder Hill!</u></h3><p>Wally West, and his friend Jimmy, are returning home from a fishing trip. After they part company, West sees Kitty Clark, a fellow classmate. When Clark's horse begins running wild, West intervenes, as Kid Flash. After calming Clark's steed, Kid Flash departs, leaving Clark to ponder how he knew her name. Kid Flash, as West, meets up with his father. The two are set to compete in a road rally, against West's father's friends, engineers Gardner and Cooper. West serves as his father's navigator, keeping check on their speed and distance with a stop watch. Unbeknownst to the other competitors, a pair of thieves are using the rally to mask their getaway.</p><p>When the thieves' car breaks down, they commandeer West's car, at gunpoint. After roughing up West's father, and rendering him unconscious, the thieve's lock West and his father in the basement of an abandoned house. West, as Kid Flash, escapes by vibrating his molecules through the basement wall. Catching up with the thieves, Kid Flash generates a cushion of air beneath the car, lifting it off the ground. Maintaining the cushion, Kid Flash races the thieves to the nearest police precinct. Kid Flash tows the car back to his father. After West's father has been looked over by a doctor, they rejoin the rally. Thanks to West's precise navigational timekeeping, the West's win the rally.</p>",,,,,,,False,5032,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4285773-116.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",116,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Man Who Stole Central City!; The Race to Thunder Hill!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-116-the-man-who-stole-central-city-the-r/4000-5032/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The Flash, also in Hollywood to consult on the filming of a Flash movie, consents to an interview.West is surprised that the Flash isn't actually starring in his own film. During the course of the interview, West hits upon the idea of inviting her boyfriend, police forensics scientist Barry Allen, out to Hollywood. Unbeknownst to West, Allen is also the Flash. As West goes to phone Allen, the Flash bolts out of the restaurant, races across country, and arrives in Allen's apartment in time to answer the call. The Flash, as Allen, consents to spending his vacation, in California, with West.Then, the Flash races back to the restaurant.</p><p>The Flash gets back to their booth, before West can return to the table. When West criticizes Allen's chronic tardiness, the Flash enters into a friendly wager with West, guaranteeing that Allen won't be late for his date with West. The Flash returns to the set of the movie, concerned over several attempts on the life of the film's star, Steve Palmer. In the projection room, the Flash watches the latest dailies for the film. In a sequence called ""The Doomed Scarecrow"", the Flash himself steps in for the filming, The Flash uses his super-speed to stop incendiary bullets from igniting a scarecrow, filled with hidden evidence. The Flash takes Palmer's place in the film, in order to catch the would-be killer.</p><p>As all of Palmer's mysterious ""accidents"" have revolved around equipment failure, suspicion falls first on the prop man, Hank Walters. Rather than bother with special effects and film trickery, the Flash opts to actually use his powers in his portrayal of himself. The Flash is called, along with several extras, to film the ""mine scene"". While the Flash goes over the script with the extras, an explosion causes a real collapse in the mine. Moving at super-human speed, the Flash quickly digs a tunnel to the surface, before the air runs out underground. Returning to his trailer, the Flash is hit from behind, and wakes up bound in ropes.The would-be killer turns out to be Palmer himself.</p><p>Palmer rigged all of his ""accidents"" in the hopes of getting the Flash to take his place in the film. When the mine collapse failed to kill the Flash, Palmer hid in the Flash's trailer to ambush him. Palmer intends to replace the Flash, cashing in on the Flash's name to make millions through endorsements. Palmer, and his men, are about to gun the Flash down, when West comes knocking at the Flash's trailer door. Their attention drawn to the door, the Flash uses the distraction to vibrate out of the ropes. The Flash attacks Palmer, and his men, quickly taking them all out. At the Brown Derby, West seemingly wins their bet, when Allen fails to appear. The Flash departs. West walks to her booth to discover Allen sitting there, waiting for her. The Flash has won the bet, after all.</p><h3><ins>The Midnight Peril!</ins></h3><p>To gain entry into the Eta Pi Fraternity, of Blue Valley High School, Wally West and Peter Willard are required to stay, in a reputably haunted house, until Midnight. Nervously talking to get his mind off ghosts, Willard reveals that while he may believe in ghosts, he doesn't believe in Kid Flash. Willard cites a recent incident at the school, where Kid Flash supposedly played every instrument in the school's orchestra at the same time. West assures Willard that Kid Flash did, in fact, perform that particular feat. The sound of chains clanking heralds the arrival of a pair of ghosts, who chase the boys out of the house.</p><p>Willard runs screaming into the darkness, but West returns to the house, as Kid Flash. Moving faster than the eye can see, Kid Flash discovers the ""ghosts"" are really a couple of crooks, using the ""haunted"" house as a hideout. Covering himself with a sheet, Kid Flash, moving at super-speed, creates the illusion that the house is actually full of ghosts. The two crooks tear off into the night, with Kid Flash pursuing them. Kid Flash herds the two crooks towards the nearest police station. Kid Flash heads off to look for Willard.</p><p>In the darkness, Willard has caught his foot between two stones, at the base of a hill. A lightning bolt strikes the top of the hill, starting a landslide of earth and stones. Responding to Willard's cries of distress, Kid Flash races across the face of the hill, deflecting all the stones away from Willard. Once Kid Flash frees Willard's leg, he returns to the house, as West. Willard returns, as well. Once the midnight hour has struck, the two boys have earned their pace in the Eta Pit Fraternity.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",,,,,,,False,5177,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4285774-118.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",118,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55701/', 'id': 55701, 'name': 'Hollywood', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hollywood/4020-55701/'}]",The Doomed Scarecrow!; The Midnight Peril!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-118-the-doomed-scarecrow-the-midnight-pe/4000-5177/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Manners is traveling with his niece, Gail, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, Picture News reporter, Iris West, and her nephew, Wally. With Manners, Gail, and West waiting at the dock, Allen takes Wally aside, and reveals his secret identity, as the Flash. Allen and West, as the Flash and Kid Flash, race to the waterfront. The Scarlet Speedsters take time out to clear the streets of all civilians, as a troubled plane comes in for a landing. Once aboard the boat, and well on their way, Manners lays out his theories as to why he believes the continents were all, once, a single land mass.</p><p>Manners hopes to find either an aardvark, or a lemur, in South America, proving that it was once connected to Africa. Upon arrival, the expedition party finds that their native guides refuse to lead them through the ""Valley of the Sleeping Giant"". The ""Sleeping Giant"" is really a volcano, which, shortly, erupts. The volcano's eruption touches off a violent ground tremor, which hurls the expedition party down the mountainside. After setting up base camp, Allen and West seek out the high ground to get an overview of the surrounding area. There they discover an enormous human footprint. Allen and West offer to do some scouting. Unbeknownst to the rest of the party, they will do so as the Flash and Kid Flash.</p><p>Responding to a cry of distress, the Flash and Kid Flash discover a primitive, being menaced by a gargantuan avian horror. The Scarlet Speedsters drive the feathered monstrosity away, then follow the primitive to his village. The primitives keep saying the word ""Grodan"", but their language is unintelligible to the Scarlet Speedsters. The Flash and Kid Flash are brought before the tribe's historian. Judging by his paintings, the Flash determines that ""Grodan"" means ""Giant"". As if on cue, an enormous golden hand grabs the Flash. Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flash is able to send a shock down the giant's arm, before the giant can crush him to death. The Scarlet Speedsters lead the giant away from the tribal village, then collect some cable from their own base camp.</p><p>After using the cable to trip the giant, the Scarlet Speedsters bind him. At the giant's defeat, an eclipse begins. With no eclipse scheduled for any part of the world, the Flash's suspicions about their surrounding are confirmed. Somehow, the ground vibrations, triggered by the volcano's eruption, has sent them back, millions of years into the past. The Scarlet Speedsters race around the globe, confirming both the Flash's fears, and Manners' theory regarding a super-continent. Suddenly, the sea begins to flow into the crack, between what will become South America and Africa. The oceanic force begins to divide the land masses. The Scarlet Speedsters evacuate the tribal village. A horde of Giants charge the Scarlet Speedsters.</p><p>Before they can reach them, though, the Giants are swept away by the rapidly rising sea. The Scarlet Speedsters race back to the base camp. Moving so fast as to be naked to the human eye, the Flash takes ahold of Manners and West, while Kid Flash grabs Gail. Matching their vibrations to the exact frequency of the volcanic ground tremor, the Scarlet Speedsters proper everyone back to the present. The Flash and Kid Flash, as Allen and West, rendezvous back with the expedition party. Though the base camp has been destroyed, Manners was able to preserve his camera.

Fashion designer Anton Previn gives Iris a makeover while Flash battles a new villain.</em></p><h3><ins>Beware The Atomic Grenade!</ins></h3><p>Arriving in Central City, world famous fashion designer, Anton Previn. contacts his old friend, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. After Allen secures Previn's latest designs, in a safe at police headquarters, the two men spend the day together, rekindling their friendship. Allen is excited to introduce Previn to his girlfriend, reporter Iris West. Before Allen gets the chance to introduce Previn, West tells Allen about Central City's newest super-criminal, the Top. After robbing the Wimbell's Department Store payroll, the Top had found himself being pursued by a crowd of law-abiding citizens. Hurling a top that entangled his pursuers with confetti-like steel streamers, the Top escaped.</p><p>After Allen introduces Previn to West, Allen decides to go after the Top, as the Flash. West and Previn become fast friends. Previn even offers to give West a makeover, to make her more desirable to Allen. Intercepting a police radio bulletin, the Flash races to the site of a robbery in progress. A robbery being pulled off by the Top. The Flash hangs back to allow Central City's Police Department to arrest the Top. The Top covers his escape with a top-shaped smoke grenade. The Flash races through the smoke, but the Top is ready for him. Spinning at incredible velocity, the Top proves impossible to grab. When the Flash tries, he is flung down, hard, to the ground.</p><p>With the Flash unconscious, the Top makes good his escape. Back in his secret lair, the Top reflects on his origin. As a young boy, Roscoe Dillon discovered some wooden tops, in an old box, tucked away in the attic. Dillon became fascinated by tops, eschewing all other activities in favor of spinning tops. As an adult, Dillon drifted into a life of crime. After his second arrest, Dillon decided to seek out a new modus operandi. Returning to his boyhood obsession, Dillon began researching tops. After learning how to spin as fast as a top, Dillon found that, inexplicably, the high velocity spinning expanded his intellect. After the success of his smaller crimes, the Top decides to go for his big score.</p><p>Interrupting the television and radio broadcasts across the entire world, the Top threatens to destroy half the planet, with an atomic grenade top, unless his is recognized as the sole ruler of the Earth. Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flash tracks the Top's broadcast frequency back to his secret lair. The Top incapacitates the Flash with a bolo top. The Top spins his atomic grenade, giving the world a mere 10 hours to comply with his demands. The Flash awakes to find himself trapped inside the atomic grenade, pinned to it's walls by centrifugal force. Vibrating his molecules into intangibility, the Flash escapes from within the top.</p><p>To keep the top from slowing down, the Flash races around it at super-speed. Increasing his speed, the Flash builds up a mass of compressed air beneath the top, ultimately launching it into orbit. The Flash catches up with the Top on the northern coast of Africa. The Flash upends the Top, and spins him so fast that he begins to drill down into the Earth. After hitting oil, the Top is thrown back to the surface, The Flash carries the Top back to Central City, and jail. West unveils her new look to Allen, who is struck speechless by her beauty. Misinterpreting his silence for disapproval, West resumes her former hair style, and overall look.</p><h3><ins>The Face Behind The Mask!</ins></h3><p>Pop idol Silver Mask is mobbed by his adoring fans, at a train station in Blue Valley.

Prepare for the meeting of the Flash of two worlds!</em></p><p>Barry Allen travels to Earth-Two and encounters Jay Garrick, The Flash of Earth-Two. Who is the real Flash, Barry Allen or Jay Garrick? This classic Silver Age story resurrected the Golden Age Flash and provided a foundation for the Multiverse homes from which he and the Silver Age Flash would hail. It was fitting that the historic meeting between the two Flashes should be written by Gardner Fox and drawn by Carmine Infantino, who had both chronicled the adventures of the Golden Age Flash in the 1940s. The creative duo sent the Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, through an interdimensional rift to a parallel Earth where he would meet the childhood idol he had read about in ""Flash Comics."" Allen's timing couldn't have been better: Jay Garrick, now 20 years older, had just decided to come out of retirement in the midst of a mysterious crime wave in Keystone City - a string of thefts by his old arch nemesis the Thinker, the Shade and the Fiddler.</p><p>The Flashes became fast friends, and tracked down the dastardly trio to the Keystone City Museum, where they thwarted the villains' plan to steal rare gems. The experience motivated Jay Garrick to remain out of retirement, while Barry Allen returned home to track down Flash Comic's writer Gardner Fox and tell him of the fantastic adventure he had just shared with his ""creation.""</p>",,,,,,,False,5443,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11122/111224684/4480839-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20123-000.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images,Flash #123'}",123,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55854/', 'id': 55854, 'name': 'Kansas', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kansas/4020-55854/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-40924/', 'id': 40924, 'name': 'Keystone City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keystone-city/4020-40924/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55752/', 'id': 55752, 'name': 'Missouri', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/missouri/4020-55752/'}]",Flash of Two Worlds!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55817/', 'id': 55817, 'name': 'Fiddle Car', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fiddle-car/4055-55817/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-59382/', 'id': 59382, 'name': ""Fiddler's Fiddle"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fiddlers-fiddle/4055-59382/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-59340/', 'id': 59340, 'name': ""Flash's Winged Helmet"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flashs-winged-helmet/4055-59340/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60266/', 'id': 60266, 'name': ""Shade's Cane"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/shades-cane/4055-60266/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-123-flash-of-two-worlds/4000-5443/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Master second-story man, James Lawton, had vowed to seek revenge on everyone involved in his trial. Upon his release from prison, Lawton holed up in a remote location, and put his plan into motion. Harnessing Psi-radiation, Lawton found he could mentally dominate anyone he saw on television. Edgar Barnard, the foreman of Lawton's jury, landed a spot on a television game show. It was there that Lawton took control of Barnard's mind, commanding him to come to Lawton.</p><p>As luck would have it, the Judge, the Warden, and West, whose articles had put the police on Lawton's trail, all appeared on the same television program. Taking control of their minds, Lawton drew them all to him. Lawton caged all of his victims, and waited for the moment he could snare the Flash. Eventually, the Flash, too, appeared on television, interviewed about the four missing people. Lawton seized the Flash's mind, and bade him to come to him. Before he carries out his vengeance on all of them, Lawton decided to first unmask the Flash.</p><p>The Flash, though, has only feigned being in Lawton's control.

Wally West joins his mentor, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, in Central City. Incredibly, Allen has invented a time machine. Using his ""cosmic treadmill"", Allen, as the Flash traveled into the future. In the year 2287, the Flash finds humanity on the verge of being wiped out by alien invaders. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash learns that the aliens, known as the Dokris, have sent a radiation absorbing ""hive"" back into Earth's distant past. With the hive rendering all atomic elements inert, mankind can never develop atomic energy, or atomic weapons.</p><p>Without their atomic weapons, the humans of the future have no way of defending themselves from the Dokris. The Flash sends West, as Kid Flash, back to the year 100,842,246 B.C. Kid Flash's mission is to find the Dokris hive, and destroy it. Meanwhile, the Flash returns to the year 2287 to aid humanity against the Dokris. Upon arriving in the past, Kid Flash encounters a giant, web-spinning ant, which has entangled a human-headed bird. Kid Flash frees the strange bird-creature, then tangles the ant up in it's own web. Kid Flash begins his hunt for the hive. Suddenly, Kid Flash is attacked by a giant bee, which stings him, and carries him into the sky.</p><p>Spying a nest of the bird-creatures, Kid Flash begins vibrating at super-human speed, to drive the bee lower. As Kid Flash had hoped, the bird-creatures come to his rescue. Despite the language barrier, Kid Flash is able to convey to the bird-creatures how important it is to him to find the hive. Flying off in multiple directions, the bird-creatures join the search. Kid Flash is just about to join the hunt, when the delayed effects of the bee's stinger paralyzes him. In the year 2287, the Dokris have ferreted out the location of a large concentration of humans. The Flash tracks the humans to an abandoned series of caves, once known as ""Colossal Caverns"".</p><p>The Flash convinces the men hiding there that soon their weapons will be functional again. The Flash lures the Dokris hunters into an old monorail tunnel, then seals them inside. One Dokris hunter comes up from the rear and floors the Flash with a radiation blast. After telepathically probing the Flash's mind, the Dokris leader, Mynher, offers the Flash the opportunity to join the invaders. When the Flash refuses, he is imprisoned in a cell, one which continues to bombard him with the enervating radiation. The Flash keeps pulling the trigger on an atomic pistol, anticipating the moment when Kid Flash completes his assignment.</p><p>At last, the atomic pistol discharges, blowing a large hole in the cell wall. It takes every last shred of strength the Flash has left to stagger out of the cell. Once free of the radiation field, the Flash's super-speed returns. A power he puts to good use, battling against the Dokris. Joined by the human resistance fighters, now armed with fully functional atomic pistols, the Flash is able to drive the Dokris off Earth. Returning to the present, the Flash learns the details of Kid Flash's mission. Having discovered the hive, the bird-creatures provided an antidote to the bee's paralytic stinger. Once back on his feet, Kid Flash destroyed the Dokris hive, restoring atomic energy across history. The crisis past, the Flash and Kid Flash, as Allen and West, meet up with reporter Iris West, for dinner.</p>",,,,,,,False,5608,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/5151-1995-5608-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",125,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",Conquerors of Time!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-125-conquerors-of-time/4000-5608/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Meanwhile, Barry and Iris attend a costume party on Earth 1, and the proceeds are stolen by Captain Cold. Two crimes, two Flashes! Jay Garrick and Barry Allen once again join forces as the Flash of Two Worlds!</em></p><p>A comet strikes the sun, touching off a solar flare of deadly epsilon radiation. The entire populace of Earth is in danger of being wiped out by the radiation. A meteorite is discovered in Arizona that can absorb the fatal radiation. Jay Garrick is tasked, by the President of The United States, to find a way to use the meteor to absorb all the radiation. When Garrick arrives in Arizona, though, he can find no trace of the meteor. Garrick, as the Golden Age Flash, travels to Earth-1, in the hopes of finding a similar meteor, on the parallel world. Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, and Picture News reporter, Iris West, are attending a costumed Headline Makers Ball. Allen sees several party guests dressed in the costumes of notorious criminals, like the Mirror Master and the Top.</p><p>Two such ""guests"" truly are Captain Cold and the Trickster. Captain Cold is in the process of looting the charity receipts, when the Trickster interrupts and takes the money for himself. The Trickster is quick to disable Captain Cold's gun. Recognizing a robbery when he sees one, the Golden Age Flash intervenes, preventing the Trickster from escaping. Unjamming his weapon, Captain Cold lays an ice sheath across the floor. The Golden Age Flash skids into a wall, knocking himself out. Proving there's no honor among thieves, the Trickster flies off with the loot, leaving Captain Cold behind. Learning of the robbery, Allen investigates, as the Flash. Encountering his counterpart, the Flash is brought up to speed on the situation.</p><p>The two Flashes take off in pursuit of the fleeing felons. The Flashes find Captain Cold and the Trickster fighting over the stolen money. Captain Cold quickly freezes the Flash. The Golden Age Flash closes in on Captain Cold, only to be hooked by the Trickster. With the Trickster holding the Golden Age Flash in the air, Captain Cold is able to easily freeze him, as well. Acknowledging how well they work together, Captain Cold and the Trickster form a partnership. Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flashes shatter their icy encasements. While the Golden Age Flash gets on with his mission to collect the meteor, the Silver Age Flash pursues Captain Cold and the Trickster. The Golden Age Flash finds that the meteor on Earth-1 is much larger, and still buried.</p><p>The Golden Age Flash excavates the meteor, then breaks it up into smaller pieces. The Golden Age Flash has the meteor fragments flown back to Central City. There, he and the Silver Age Flash build a vibratory transport that will teleport the meteor fragments to Earth-2. Thanks to a story planted in the latest edition of Picture News, Captain Cold and the Trickster are led to believe the meteor fragments are valuable. The two costumed crooks show up to steal it, falling into the Flashes' trap. It's all the two felons can do to escape. The Golden Age Flash goes after the Trickster, and brings him down to Earth with a super-speed generated wind column. The Trickster, though, turns out to be one of Captain Cold's mirages.</p><p>Anticipating that tactic, the Silver Age Flash stayed on Captain Cold's trail, while leaving a path for the Golden Age Flash to follow. The Silver Age Flash confronts Captain Cold and the Trickster in their hideout. While their attention is on their old foe, the Golden Age Flash, moving so fast as to be invisible, grabs their hands and turns their weapons on themselves.

Allen investigates the matter, as the Flash. Starting his investigation at the penitentiary, the Flash is puzzled to discover that the Mirror Master is actually still incarcerated. Patrolling Central City, the Flash encounters his old foe, the Trickster. Unable to slow his momentum in time, the Flash runs headlong into the Trickster's boxing glove missile. In the time it takes the Flash to recover, the Trickster has escaped. Returning to the penitentiary, the Flash finds that the Trickster, too, is still behind bars.</p><p>In the days that follow, Captain Cold, the Top and Captain Boomerang are all sighted in Central City. A quick check, though, reveals that none have actually escaped from prison. The Flash calls on Paul Barrett, the public defense attorney who represented all five criminals. Barrett clearly knows something but hides behind attorney/client privilege. Putting a match to his pipe, Barrett begins filling the room with knockout gas. Once the Flash has been sequestered away, Barrett opens his closet, revealing the costumes of all five criminals. A Flash costume also hangs with the criminals' attire. Putting on the Flash costume, Barrett visits the penitentiary, and asks to see the Mirror Master.</p><p>Fooled by Barrett's disguise, the warden readily agrees to the ""Flash's"" request. Once alone in the cell with the Mirror Master, Barrett reveals that his mind has been enslaved since the Mirror Master's trial. Barret changes clothes with the Mirror Master. Dressed as the Flash, the Mirror Master walks out of the penitentiary, to freedom. Returning to Barrett's office, the Mirror Master exchanges the Flash's costume for his own. Checking on the Flash, the Mirror Master reveals his hand in the Scarlet Speedster's current predicament. The Flash stands stock still beneath the glaring lights of several overhead lamps. Should he make one move, the room is wired to explode.</p><p>When a moth flies harmlessly into the light without triggering the explosives, the Flash hits upon a plan for escape. Loosening a recent filling on his tooth, the Flash spits the tooth into the pilot light, shattering it. The minor disruption in the current gives the Flash his window to freedom. After grilling Barrett for information regarding the Mirror Master's next crime, the Flash heads for the Dagon Payroll company. Before the Mirror Master can react, the Flash is on him. After completely disarming him of all of his weaponized mirrors, the Flash carries the MIrror Master back to jail. The Flash, as Allen, returns to his dentist, to have the filling replaced.</p><h3><ins>Kid Flash Meets The Elongated Man!</ins></h3><p>The Flash pays a call on his young protege, Wally West. The Flash has received a request for assistance from the Elongated Man. Not wishing to shelve his vacation plans with his girlfriend, reporter <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/iris-west-allen/4005-9977/"" data-ref-id=""4005-9977"">Iris West</a>, the Flash asks West to step in for him. West, as Kid Flash, meets the Elongated Man, at his hotel, in Goldville, Wyoming. The Elongated Man reveals that Oakley County has been cut off from the rest of the state by increasingly inclement weather. Reaching the outskirts of town, the two heroes have to abandon the Elongated Man's car, and continue on foot. The residents of Goldville have been issued a ransom note, from the Weather Wizard, for the return of Spring. In truth, Weather Wizard's actions in Goldville are merely a prelude to an attack on the entire country. Having split up to cover more ground, the Elongated Man runs across a bank robbery.</p><p>As he pursues the fleeing criminals, the weather actually grows steadily worse around the Elongated Man. Stretching out, the Elongated Man is able to snare one of the crooks, and learns that the Weather Wizard is the true villain behind the crisis. Kid Flash discovers the Weather Wizard's Weather Control Station, and storms it. Though caught off guard, the Weather Wizard is able to conceal himself in a thick fog, before Kid Flash can get to him. Lost in the fog, Kid Flash falls easy prey to the Weather Wizard. The Elongated Man also storms the Weather Control Station, but the Weather Wizard traps him in a lightning field. Unseen, Kid Flash recovers and pulls the Elongated Man out of the lightning field. The two heroes combine their powers to defeat the Weather Wizard. With the Weather Wizard back behind bars, Spring comes, at last, to Goldville, Wyoming.</p>",,,,,,,False,6004,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4306438-130.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images,All-Star Comics #6'}",130,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56121/', 'id': 56121, 'name': 'Wyoming', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wyoming/4020-56121/'}]",Who Doomed the Flash?,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58442/', 'id': 58442, 'name': ""Trickster's Gadgets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tricksters-gadgets/4055-58442/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57175/', 'id': 57175, 'name': ""Weather Wizard's Wand"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/weather-wizards-wand/4055-57175/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': ''}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-130-who-doomed-the-flash/4000-6004/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The two men eventually make it back to the estate of Jordan's boss, Carol Ferris. Having tied each other in a sporting contest, the two men compete in an archery competition, to determine the winner. Suddenly, an unidentified flying object buzzes the grounds of the Ferris Estate. In the confusion, Allen and Jordan slip away, only to reappear in their costumed identities, the Flash and the Green Lantern. The two heroes are in pursuit of the strange craft when it captures the Flash in a tractor beam. Green Lantern pursues the craft to a distant alien world.</p><p>Though the craft releases the Flash, Green Lantern continues his pursuit. Green Lantern grounds the craft with the power of his ring, only to discover it is unmanned. Suspecting he may have been lured into a trap, Green Lantern sets off to rendezvous with the Flash. The Scarlet Speedster finds himself slowly trudging through a snowstorm, one that seemingly formed out of nothingness. A massive creature coalesces out of the snow before him. Vibrating at super-speed, the Flash dissipates the creature before it can attack. All at once, the snow storm ends.</p><p>The Flash is confronted by a transparent alien, armed with a strange gun. The alien fires on the Flash causing the Flash to be upended. No matter how hard he tries, the Flash can't right himself. Learning to run on his hands at super-speed, the Flash kicks his attacker into unconsciousness. Meanwhile, Green Lantern is drawn down to the planet's surface by a rapid increase in the planet's gravity. Breaking his fall with a power ring constructed mattress, Green Lantern finds himself held fast by the planetary gravity. A river of molten metal erupts out of a nearby hill. Mustering the full force of his willpower, Green Lantern manages to raise just high enough to avoid being consumed.</p><p>All at once, gravity returns to normal. The Green Lantern meets back up with the Flash. While comparing notes, the two men are suddenly grabbed by a living mountain range. The Flash vibrates his way to freedom. The Green Lantern constructs a ring powered pile driver to break himself free. With the entire planet seemingly trying to kill them, the two heroes depart, and return to Earth. Upon arriving in Coast City, the two heroes are stunned to see an enormous robot looming on the outskirts of town. Racing to confront it, the pair of heroes are stopped short by a holographic alien head, barring their path. The alien, a Myrmiton, telepathically informs the two heroes that Earth has been conquered.</p><p>The Flash and the Green Lantern were lured away, off world, to give the Myrmitons the time they needed to take the Earth. Holding the entire Earth hostage, under the threat of destruction by cosmic radiation, the Myrmitons force the Flash and the Green Lantern to surrender. The Green Lantern allows the Myrmitons to draw away his power ring. The Flash allows the Myrmitons to bathe him in cosmic radiation, neutralizing his super-speed powers. No longer in possession of their great powers, the Flash and the Green Lantern dejectedly wander the streets of Coast City. Speaking to the Green Lantern telepathically, the Flash reveals that all is not how it seems.</p><p>Moving so fast that he left an after image of himself behind, the Flash raced into a department store and grabbed the fake power ring off a Green Lantern mannequin, while also carrying the Flash mannequin back with him. Moving faster than the eye could see, The Flash removed the real power ring from the Green Lantern's finger, replacing it with the replica. The Flash then placed the Flash mannequin in his place, so that<em> it</em> was bombarded with the power destroying cosmic radiation. The Myrmitons discover the Flash's ruse, just as the two heroes are racing up towards their base. The Myrmitons' headquarters, however, is protected by a powerful force field.</p><p>Stopped by the field, the Flash and the Green Lantern are easy targets for the Myrmitons, who disintegrate the two heroes with cosmic rays. Once again, though, the two heroes have perpetrated a ruse. Aware of the Myrmitons' force field, the Green Lantern animated the two mannequins, sending them on a frontal assault. The real Green Lantern used his power ring to tunnel under the base's defenses. Taking the Myrmitons by surprise, the Flash and the Green Lantern are quick to defeat the alien conquerors.

When things begin to calm down on Earth, an executive at Tel-Vis, Dro Dorno, decides to manufacture threats to maintain his viewership, and his profit margins. Dorno pays a visit to the Institute of Higher Learning to welcome a visiting celebrity to Gobdor. Dorno is aghast to discover that the celebrity is the Flash, one of Earth's famed defenders. When a teacher, Elider, at the institute attempts to show Flash Dorno's program, ""Thrills of Earth"", Dorno interferes with the broadcast. The Flash momentarily hears cries of distress, before the screen goes black.</p><p>Intent on keeping the Flash from interfering with events happening on Earth, Dorno escorts the Flash on a tour of Gobdor. When the Flash's attention is caught by a Tel-Vis monitor, Dorno dissipates a ""swimming block"", imperiling an old woman. The Flash moves the elderly woman out of harm's way, then rescues all the swimmers caught in the sudden collapse of the swimming block. Still moving at super-speed, the Flash finally bears witness to the threat the Tel-Vis company is currently broadcasting. The Flash immediately returns to Earth. The citizens of Central City are being menaced by a pair of seemingly living, high tension relay towers.</p><p>The Flash fails in his first attempt to stop the animated electrical towers, leading Dorno to believe his fears were baseless. Grabbing up a hammer and metal punch, the Flash pounds out all the rivets holding the towers together, dismantling them. Furious over the Flash's interference, Dorno travels to Earth, intent on murdering the Flash. Analyzing the metal of the tower, the Flash discovers that it pulses with the same radiation the Tel-Vis company uses to broadcast it's programming. The Flash sets off for Gobdor. As he tries to pick up the necessary speed to traverse the dimensional rift between Gobdor and Earth, the Flash finds himself growing heavier.</p><p>The increase in his mass begins to slow him down, until he literally begins sinking into the ground. Before him, the Flash sees Dorno, bathing him in a strange radiation. The Flash discovers that by running backwards he can counter the effects of his mass increase. After taking Dorno down, the Flash carries him back to Gobdor. Dorno, and his compatriots at Tel-Vis, are tried and sentenced, in a Gobdor court of law. Elider tells Flash that the program, ""Thrills of Earth"", has been cancelled, and that no program like it will ever air on Gobdor again.</p><h3><ins>The Farewell Appearance of Daphne Dean</ins></h3><p>Reporter, Iris West, learns from reading the society column, that famed actress, Daphne Dean, has switched her affection from police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, to the Flash. Unbeknownst to neither West, nor Dean, Allen<em> is</em> the Flash. The Flash suddenly appears in West's office, to deliver to her a note from Allen. The note details Allen's desire to change his lunch date with West to a dinner date. With his afternoon freed up, the Flash turns his attention to Dean. Agreeing to meet with the young actress, the Flash goes to work de-glamorizing himself in Dean's eyes.</p><p>The Flash reveals that the stories of his super-speed powers are nothing more than a publicity stunt. The Flash dismisses Dean's own memories of his powers, citing the dazed state she witnessed them in. As the pair continue to wander the streets of Central City, the Flash spies the ""Cranky"" Dilger Gang heading into a bank. Distracting Dean with a Flash toy in a shop window, the Flash spends the next five seconds taking down the gang. Returning to Dean's side before she even noticed he had gone, the Flash realizes he's forgotten the getaway driver.</p><p>Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash vibrates his way into the shop, and activates the Flash toy. With Dean's attention on the toy's movements, the Flash takes the next three seconds to run down the getaway driver, and leave him on the steps of the nearest police precinct house. Once more returning to Dean's side, before she has noticed his absence, the Flash is surprised to hear that Dean is leaving Central City. A letter from Dean to Allen, reveals that Dean watched the Flash's super-speed antics, in the reflection of the shop window. Dean realized that the Flash was trying to let her down easy, and spare her the heartbreak of an unrequited love. Crestfallen, Dean departed Central City.</p><h4><strong>Notes:</strong></h4><ul><li>This comic book appeared in the movie <em>Catch Me if You Can</em>.</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,6131,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4332790-132.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",132,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Heaviest Man Alive!; The Farewell Appearance of Daphne Dean,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-132-the-heaviest-man-alive-the-farewell-/4000-6131/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Abra Kadabra uses this device to hypnotize the Governor into signing a pardon, releasing Abra Kadabra from prison. When news of Abra Kadabra's release reaches police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, he decides to investigate the matter, as the Flash. Staring out over Central City's skyline, from his luxurious penthouse apartment, Abra Kadabra finds inspiration for a new performance. A performance guaranteed to bestow upon him the fame and fortune he covets.</p><p>Allen attends the performance with his girlfriend, reporter Iris West. The performance turns out to be a puppet show, where a puppet of the Flash is humiliated by a puppet villain, called ""Captain Creampuff"". The show is an enormous hit, playing to sold-out crowds. Allen is none to thrilled with what he takes to be Abra Kadabra's attack on the Flash's credibility with the public. To counter Abra Kadabra's campaign of ridicule, the Flash steps up his efforts to rid Central City of crime. His relentless efforts to clean up the streets of Central City garner the Flash big headlines on a daily basis. So enamored are the citizens of Central City with the Flash's heroic deeds that attendance begins to drop off sharply for Abra Kadabra's puppet show.</p><p>In retaliation, Abra Kadabra papers Central City with posters advertising his show. As the Flash runs past one these posters, he is suddenly bathed in a strange radiation, that transforms him into a marionette. Abra Kadabra collects the Flash, and brings him back to the theater. After forcing the Flash to applaud Abra Kadabra's ""brilliant feat"", the Flash is placed into the puppet show. Completely unable to move, the Flash is humiliated, nightly, by ""Captain Creampuff"", to the rapturous amusement of Central City's inhabitants. Only the Flash's brain has been left unchanged by Abra Kadabra's future science, so that he may feel his humiliation.</p><p>Exercising his complete control of his own molecules, the Flash fires off extra molecules, from his brain, into his costume, causing it to inflate like a balloon. Breaking loose from his strings, the Flash slowly moves forward. Abra Kadabra is so taken aback by the spectacle that he allows the Flash to stumble, ploddingly, near enough to him to be knocked unconscious, Picking up Abra Kadabra's wand, the Flash reverses his transformation, restoring himself to normal. Abra Kadabra is returned to prison. Later, the Flash, as Allen, is hanging out with West, when she idly remarks that Allen and the Flash seem to hold to the same schedule. Allen readily admits to West that he is the Flash. West finds the notion ludicrous.</p><h3><ins>Secret Of The Handicapped Boys!</ins></h3><p>Kid Flash heads out to the Sunfield Camp For Handicapped Children, to perform feats of speed for their amusement. Each of his speed challenges have been dreamed up by the camp's children. After completing three challenges, to the amazement of his admirers, Kid Flash settles in for a day spent with the children. Over lunch, Kid Flash receives a note to meet three of the boys at a remote location. The three boys are the blind Harry Watkins, deaf Dave Dent, and mute Freddy Garson. All three boys know Kid Flash, in his civilian identity, Wally West. Now, they reveal that they know Kid Flash is West. Watkins recognized Kid Flash's voice as West's.</p><p>Dent's lipreading skills noticed the similarities in the way Kid Flash and West speak. Garson recognized Kid Flash's handwriting as West's. Before Kid Flash can react to their revelation, the platform two of the boys are standing on collapses, sending them falling down the cliffside. Kid Flash rescues the boys, returns them to the camp, and departs. The next day, West receives a small statue in the mail. It is of three monkeys. One which sees no evil. One which hears no evil.

While the Flash inspected one of the weapons, a ""mind over matter"" device, the unit projected the designs he contemplated for a new Kid Flash costume onto his protege.

While in the office, Allen overhears a news bulletin, regarding the Mirror Master's escape from prison. Allen sneaks out of the office, to investigate the case, as the Flash. Led to the Mirror Master's cell by the prison's warden, the Flash determines how the Mirror Master escaped. The Mirror Master drew a bolt of lightning into a bucket of sand, with a loose piece of wire. The lightning bolt fused the sand into glass, which the Mirror Master then ground and polished into a mirror. With a mirror in his possession, escape was child's play.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the Flash, the Mirror Master's motivation for escaping was due to his poor showing in a poll of most successful criminals, published in the prison's paper. Prior to beginning his newest criminal campaign, the Mirror Master creates two mirror bodyguards to protect him from the Flash. The Mirror Master strikes first at a downtown salon. When the Flash arrives on the scene, the Mirror Master quickly activates his mirror bodyguards. The mirror images blast the Flash into unconsciousness. Upon recovering, the Flash attunes his inner vibrations to the same frequency the Mirror Master used to create his mirror bodyguards.</p><p>In this way, the Flash is able to track the Mirror Master back to his hidden lair. Checking his standing in the prison newspaper, the Mirror Master is overjoyed that, once again, he tops the list of Central City's most successful criminals. Storming the Mirror Master's lair, the Flash uses his mastery over his molecular structure to split off his own duplicates. While the Flash's duplicates engage the mirror bodyguards, the Flash, himself , takes down the Mirror Master. By the time the Mirror Master is incarcerated, his standing in the prison poll has hit rock bottom. Over dinner, West chastises Allen for running out on her. Much to Allen's chagrin, West has enrolled him in the self-help course.</p><h3><ins>""Barry Allen-- You're The Flash!-- And I Can Prove It!""</ins></h3><p>At work in his laboratory, Police Forensics Scientist, Barry Allen, comes across a note in his own handwriting. A note that he has no recollection of writing. The note instructs Allen to journey to the state penitentiary, and introduce himself to Rod Pagin. Allen arrives just as Pagin is being released on parole. Trancelike, Allen introduces himself. Pagin thanks Allen, then reveals that he knows Allen is the Flash. Pagin agrees to keep Allen's identity a secret, as long as Allen doesn't interfere, as the Flash, in Pagin's criminal activities. Despite the danger, the Flash still goes on patrol that night. Though he foils several crimes, none were committed by Pagin.</p><p>Arriving late at the scene of a burglary, the Flash finds a note from Pagin, thanking him for holding to their arrangement. Over the next three nights, Pagin burglarizes three more jewelry stores. Allen attends a charity ball, with his girlfriend, reporter Iris West. Allen and West have worked out a mind reading trick to raise money. While Allen performs blindfolded, ""guessing"" the items West garners from the audience, he realizes that Pagin's crimes are taunting him. The first letter in the name of each of the jewelry stores Pagin has robbed almost spells out ""Flash"". Only the last letter is missing. Moving faster than the eye can see, Allen leaves the stage, checks the phone book for all the jewelry stores in Central City that start with the letter ""H"", and nabs Pagin.</p><p>After carrying Pagin to jail, Allen gets back on stage, having only been absent for 10 seconds. Pagin holds a press conference to reveal the Flash's identity. Outing the Flash as Allen, though, only garners Pagin ridicule. Allen was seen to be on stage, at the charity ball, during the time the Flash nabbed Pagin. The master thief determines that he must have hypnotized Allen by mistake, instead of the Flash, at his trial. Thus, it was Allen who came to see him at his release, instead of the Flash, in his secret identity. West informs Allen that their act raised over $10,000.00 for charity. Their act was of even more value, though, to Allen, as it aided in protecting his secret identity.</p>",,,,,,,False,6477,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/5920-1995-6477-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",136,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56078/', 'id': 56078, 'name': 'Mirror World', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-world/4020-56078/'}]",The Mirror Master's Invincible Bodyguards,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58436/', 'id': 58436, 'name': 'Mirror Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-gun/4055-58436/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-136-the-mirror-master-s-invincible-bodyg/4000-6477/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

All forms of power, from electric lights to motor cars to flashlights, cease to operate in those cities. The city names trigger a childhood memory in police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. Each of the cities in question happen to correspond to the same cities, on Earth 2, that various members of the legendary Justice Society of America call home. Allen decides to call on his Earth 2 counterpart, as the Flash. Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flash attunes his vibratory frequency to that of Earth 2, and arrives in Keystone City, the home of the Golden Age Flash.</p><p>The Flash heads over to his counterpart's home, and is greeted by Joan Garrick, the wife of the Golden Age Flash. Soon enough, the Golden Age Flash returns home, having just visited the same cities on his world. The Golden Age Flash reveals that in each of the cities, a member of the Justice Society of America has gone missing. Suddenly, the strange lights appear over Keystone City. The two Flashes scour the city for the source of the mysterious lights. The Golden Age Flash finds it first. The moment he attempts to tamper with the device generating the lights, a glass case materializes around him. Paralyzed within the case, the Golden Age Flash is helpless as the case rises into the air, and slowly makes it's way across the city.</p><p>The Flash arrives too late to get ahold of the case before it has risen too high in the air. Generating powerful suction, by racing around in a tight circle, also fails to ground the case. Chasing the case across Keystone City, the Flash finally leaps from a rooftop onto the case, and shatters it with several super-speed blows. Grabbing ahold of his counterpart, the Flash generates a cushion of air beneath them, to slow their descent to the ground. Miles away, beneath the Mammoth Caves, in Kentucky, Vandal Savage ponders why the case carrying the Golden Age Flash never arrived. Lining Savage's headquarters are a half dozen glass cases, each holding a different member of the Justice Society of America.</p><p>Utilizing technology provided by <a href=""/brainwave/4005-9338/"" data-ref-id=""4005-9338"">Brain Wave</a>, Savage had lured, and snared, each of the six heroes in their individual cities. As he ponders what could possibly have gone wrong in Keystone City, Savage reflects on his past. Once he had been Vandar Adg, a cro-magnon man. A meteor explosion had bestowed upon him immortality. As history unfolded, Adg walked the Earth under many names, playing many roles. King of Sumer. The Egyptian pharaoh, Cheops. Genghis Khan. Napoleon's military advisor. With only the Golden Age Flash a threat to his dreams of conquest, Savage sets off to deal with him, personally. Savage catches up with the Golden Age Flash, on his second attempt to destroy the device powering the mysterious lights.</p><p>Using a weapon designed by the <a href=""/thinker/4005-23851/"" data-ref-id=""4005-23851"">Thinker</a>, Savage causes the Golden Age Flash's mass to increase, causing him to sink beneath the ground. The Flash races to his counterpart's rescue. Savage reverses the beams effects on the Flash, decreasing his mass until he begins to float in the air. Attaching a tether line to both Flashes, Savage begins dragging them back to his secret lair. Vibrating at super-speed, both Flashes are able to cause Savage to lose control of his flying craft. Savage survives the crash, and flees back to his hidden lair. After reversing the effects of the Thinker's weapon, the Flashes head off in pursuit of Savage.</p><p>The Flashes storm Savage's hideout, only to be caught in the beam of another weapon, this one designed by Per<a href=""/per-degaton/4005-4922/"" data-ref-id=""4005-4922""> Degaton</a>. Instantly, the Flashes begin trying to kill one another. Ultimately, the Flash defeats his older counterpart. Savage is quick to imprison the Golden Age Flash in a new glass case. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash charges Savage. At the last moment, he veers off, instead hurling a stone at the immortal villain. The stone disrupts the illusion of Savage, revealing another of his inescapable glass cases. With the trap sprung, Savage erroneously believes that the Flash is locked inside the case, still invisible due to his great speed.</p><p>Savage only realizes the truth when he finds himself surrounded by both Flashes, as well as the formerly imprisoned members of the Justice Society of America. Doctor Midnight disables Brain Wave's devices, restoring power to the afflicted cities. The Golden Age Wonder Woman suggests the team consider coming out of retirement, to prevent future villainous actions against them. The team agrees, and schedules a meeting for a future date. First order of business is to learn more about the parallel Flash and the world he comes from. Meanwhile, having returned to his world, the Flash, as Allen, makes his own plans, to dine with his girlfriend, reporter Iris West.</p>",,,,,,,False,6527,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4377159-137.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",137,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-61833/', 'id': 61833, 'name': 'Capitol Building', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/capitol-building/4020-61833/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56116/', 'id': 56116, 'name': 'Kentucky', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kentucky/4020-56116/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-40924/', 'id': 40924, 'name': 'Keystone City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keystone-city/4020-40924/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-65345/', 'id': 65345, 'name': 'Mammoth Cave National Park', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mammoth-cave-national-park/4020-65345/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55834/', 'id': 55834, 'name': 'The Pentagon', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-pentagon/4020-55834/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55685/', 'id': 55685, 'name': 'Washington D.C.', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/washington-dc/4020-55685/'}]",Vengeance of the Immortal Villain!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60181/', 'id': 60181, 'name': 'Heavy Ray Machine', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heavy-ray-machine/4055-60181/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60186/', 'id': 60186, 'name': 'Will Controller', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/will-controller/4055-60186/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-137-vengeance-of-the-immortal-villain/4000-6527/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-27589/', 'id': 27589, 'name': 'Justice Society of America', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

For Captain Cold!</ins></h3><p>Police Forensics Scientist, Barry Allen, and Picture News reporter, Iris West, are enjoying a nightcap in her apartment. West abruptly turns her television off, jealous over Allen's riveted attention on the television personality, ""Dream Girl"". Allen explains that he was merely waiting for ""Dream Girl"" to turn around, then explains further. It seems the Flash had been summoned to the law firm of Willens and Kohl, on an urgent matter. The senior partner, Henry Willens, laid it out for the Flash. A wealthy mining magnate, Wilson Varner, had been involved in a catastrophic ship-to-ship collision. Though Varner survived, his daughter, Priscilla, was lost at sea. Varner searched for his daughter until the day he died.</p><p>The law firm was tasked with locating her, and bestowing upon her an inheritance worth millions of dollars. Varner, however, imposed a deadline on the search. A deadline the law firm is 24 hours away from reaching. To keep Varner's millions from going to undeserving relatives, Willens asked for the Flash's aid in finding Varner's daughter. The only thing they had to go on is a baby picture of Priscilla, one that shows she has a star-shaped birthmark on the back of her neck. Allen states that he was merely trying to help the Flash out with the search. Appeased, West turns the television back on, just in time to catch a news cast regarding Captain Cold's escape from prison. Allen, as the Flash immediately goes on patrol, searching not only for Varner's daughter, but now for Captain Cold, too.</p><p>As it turns out, Captain Cold's motivation for escaping prison, this time, is to win the hand of ""Dream Girl"". According to the tabloids, ""Dream Girl's "" affections rest solely with the Flash. Captain Cold sets out to humiliate the Flash with a string of unstoppable crimes. Captain Cold strikes first at the Central City Railway Station, where exiles from the government of Guanador are arriving with their country's treasury. Captain Cold deals with the heavy police presence by firing his Cold Gun at low-hanging clouds, triggering an ice storm. Captain Cold is just about to get away with the Guanadoran bank notes, when the Flash arrives. The Flash races around Captain Cold prompting the freezing felon to fire upon one of the Flash's after-images.</p><p>The Flash is just about to deliver the knockout blow, when he is shot from behind by Central City's newest villain, Heatwave. The Flash is blasted into unconsciousness. Thankful for the timely assist, Captain Cold invites Heatwave back to his secret lair. The two villains make plans to enter into a felonious partnership. When Heatwave reveals that he embarked on a life of crime to win the hand of ""Dream Girl"", Captain Cold turns on him. The two villains instead begin a rivalry, each committing crimes to show the other up. Any time they encounter one another, an epic battle ensues, with Central City suffering millions in property damage, as a result. The Flash encounters the two criminals, blasting away at each other, in the middle of the street.</p><p>Suspending their rivalry long enough to deal with the Flash, Captain Cold and Heatwave light the Scarlet Speedster up, with their respective weapons. Vibrating his molecules at super-speed, the Flash conducts Captain Cold's cold attack to the left side of his body, and Heatwave's heat attack to the right side of his body. The two opposing energies cancel one another out. Waving his arm at super-speed, the Flash generates a powerful vacuum that slams the two villains together, knocking them unconscious. With the two criminals in jail, the Flash meets with ""Dream Girl"" and confirms that she is, in fact, Priscilla Varner. With only minutes to spare before the deadline, the Flash carries Varner to the law firm, where her identity is verified. When West learns that the Flash's involvement in the case led to millions of dollars of donations to Central City's poor, she chastises Allen for not doing as much as the Flash.</p><h3><ins>The Metal-Eater from the Stars!</ins></h3><p>On his way to keep a lunch date with his girlfriend, Picture News reporter Iris West, Police Forensics Scientist, Barry Allen, is pulled over by the police. Allen is informed of a mysterious object that has fallen in Central City. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Arriving at the scene, the Flash finds that the object is protected by an impenetrable radiation field. After multiple attempts fail to penetrate the field, the Flash circles the globe, to achieve the speed of light. Upon penetrating the field, the Flash finds that, though he is still moving at light speed, he can barely walk at a snail's pace. A gaseous entity rises up out of a crashed space ship, and tries to destroy the Flash.</p><p>Barely able to dodge the entity's attacks, the Flash hits upon a novel solution for dealing with it. Activating his Flash costume ring, the Flash shrinks the gaseous entity down, compressing and confining it within his ring. The Flash, as Allen, keeps his lunch date with West. For actually arriving early, West rewards Allen with a kiss. The passions stirred up by West's kiss revive the gaseous entity. Suddenly, all the metal in the room begins disappearing. Allen realizes that the metal-devouring alien is absorbing metals in their order on the periodic table. West goes to report the story to Picture News. Allen realizes he has only minutes before the alien begins absorbing gold, freeing itself from his costume ring.</p><p>The gaseous entity emerges from the costume ring, and resumes it's attack on the Flash. The Flash spins and waves and whirls his arms about at super-speed, in an attempt to dissipate the gaseous entity. All to no avail. Finally, the gaseous entity devours the gold of Flash's costume rings, destroying itself. The Flash had actually been speeding up the atoms of the rings so that when the alien absorbed them, the gaseous alien would vibrate with the atoms of the ring, dissipating it. Allen returns to West, stating that not only has the Flash solved the case, but he's offered to give West an exclusive interview. For arranging this minor miracle, Allen is rewarded with another kiss.</p>",,,,,,,False,6753,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11122/111224684/4482509-the%20flash%20%281959-1985%29%20140-000.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",140,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Heat is On...

Upon his return, the Flash attempts to apprehend the Top. The Flash grabs the Top, only to have the Top's uniform tear away in his hand, when the Top starts spinning at super-human speed. In the darkness, the still spinning Top escapes. Alone in his apartment, the Flash, as police forensics scientist Barry Allen, turns on his television, in the hopes that there will be some news of the Top. Instead he sees a news story on the slum areas of Central City. Allen watches in horror, as one of the tenement walls begins to crumble, seconds away from collapsing on a small boy.</p><p>Allen, as the Flash, races to the boy's rescue. The boy, Jimmy Darrel, was there to deliver a package. Flash retrieves the package, and notices the Top's costume inside the box. Darrel reveals that he was delivering the package for a local tailor, Paul Gambi. Suspecting Gambi to be the personal tailor of all his foes, the Flash decides to pay Gambi a visit. Disguising himself as a lowlife, the Flash, as ""Trigger Joe"", meets with Gambi, and requests a super-villain's costume. Gambi states that he doesn't do that kind of work. The headline of a newspaper in Gambi's workshop, leads the Flash to the Top's next criminal enterprise.</p><p>The Top steals a statue of ""Winged Victory"", from a local exhibition hall, incapacitating the guards with a gimmicked top that spins them like tops. Encountering the Flash, the top hurls down another trick top in the Flash's path. This top projects holographic images of the Top. The Flash runs down two of the ""Tops"", but each turn out to to be decoys. Passing through the second ""Top"", the Flash crashes into a wall, and knocks himself out. The Flash, as ""Trigger Joe"", returns to Gambi's, where he finds the tailor much more agreeable to his earlier request. Gambi outfits ""Trigger Joe"" with a science fiction themed outfit, dubbing him ""Missle Man"".</p><p>As soon as ""Trigger Joe"" suits up, the Missile Man costume becomes rigid. The costume begins to spin at super-speed, while also constricting about ""Trigger Joe"". The faster the costume spins, the tighter it becomes. The Top steps out from the back room, and reveals that he saw through the Flash's ""Trigger Joe"" disguise. With Gambi's assistance, the Top set up this very special trap for the Flash. Adding his own acceleration to the spinning suit, the Flash begins to rise in the air, before crashing back down into Gambi and the Top. With the two men taken to jail, the Flash returns ""Winged Victory"" to the exhibition hall, garnering a reward. The Flash uses the money to begin a building project to refurbish Central City's slum areas.</p><h3><ins>Slowdown In Time!</ins></h3><p>The Flash performs feats of super-human speed, at a charity bazaar. Afterwards, the Flash, as police forensics scientist Barry Allen, joins his girlfriend, Picture News reporter Iris West, and her father, physicist T. H. West, for dinner. As usual, Allen arrives late, this time due to his watch being 10 minutes slow. Strangely, Professor West takes note of the discrepancy. After Allen has departed for the evening, Professor West tells his daughter that Allen is the Flash. West, using Einstein's Theory of Relativity, has determined that because the Flash moves so fast, time moves much slower for him. The length of time the Flash performed at the bazaar, would slow time down for him by, roughly, 10 minutes. The same amount of time by which Allen's watch was off.</p><p>West finds her father's notions about Allen preposterous. Professor West decides to garner ironclad proof on the matter. Witnessing a bank robbery in progress, Professor West phones Allen. West asks Allen to meet him in precisely one hour, and insists they synchronize their watches so Allen won't be late. When news of the bank robbery reaches Allen, he heads off to thwart it, as the Flash. The Flash pursues the robbers getaway car. Professor West, in a cab, pursues the Flash. Waving his arms at super-human speed, the Flash whips up a dust storm that incapacitates the car.The bank robbers make a run for it, losing themselves in a field of tall grass.</p><p>The Flash pulls a wire fence around the field, gradually making the thieves hiding ground smaller and smaller. Once the Flash has caught the crooks, he takes them to jail. Professor West does some calculations and determines that Allen's watch will be precisely off by two minutes and four seconds. The Flash, as Allen, joins the Wests for dinner. Comparing their watches, West is amazed to find Allen's watch perfectly in sync with his own. West is crestfallen that his theory about Allen being the Flash is wrong. In truth, Allen, as the Flash, had spied West, in the cab, following him.

All four men in the line-up are Allen's friend, test pilot Hal Jordan. Using his power ring, Jordan telepathically communicates with Allen. Spying the telltale glow of Jordan's power ring, Allen gets the real Jordan remanded into his custody. After test flying the experimental X-35, in low Earth orbit, over Central City, Jordan decided to call on Allen. Outside of police headquarters Jordan encountered a man who looked just like him. This man attacked Jordan, and was swiftly joined by two more exact twins of Jordan. The police broke up the fight, which led to Jordan's appearance in the line-up. Allen and Jordan decide to investigate the situation, as the Flash and Green Lantern.</p><p>The two heroes journey to Coast City, so the Green Lantern can renew the 24 hour charge on his power ring. Suddenly the three Jordans walk in on them, garbed as Green Lanterns. One of the Green Lanterns explains the situation. While Jordan was test flying the X-35, a light beam that Jordan took for the ""Glenn Effect"", was really a duplication ray, fired at him by T.O. Morrow. Inspired by his name ""Tomorrow"", Morrow set about to invent a time machine. Though he failed in that endeavor, Morrow was able to invent a device that allowed him to view the future. Morrow then studied future inventors, and recreated their future technology in the present. One such future machine was the duplicator.</p><p>Having created three exact duplicates of Jordan, Morrow learned that Jordan was the Green Lantern. Bored with using his future technology to simply rob banks, Morrow decides to have his Green Lanterns challenge the real Green Lantern, as well as the Flash. The Green Lanterns head off to Paris, London, and New York, to steal the Mona Lisa, the Statue of Liberty, and a collection of fine gold coins. The Flash races across the Atlantic Ocean, to Paris, to stop the first theft. There he sees Morrow's Green Lantern lifting an entire wing of the Louvre, high into the air, with his power ring. The Flash races to a nearby circus, where he allows himself to be fired at the Louvre, from a cannon. Morrow's Green Lantern uses his power ring to animate the statues into attacking the Flash, while also endowing them with super-speed.</p><p>When that attack fails, Morrow's Green Lantern uses his power ring to collapse the very structure of the Louvre around the Flash. The Flash repels and deflects the debris back at his foe, who shields himself with a ring constructed force field. Painting himself yellow, the Flash charges Morrow's Green Lantern. Morrow, though, has removed the weakness to yellow from his Green Lanterns' power rings. Spinning at super-human speed, the Flash sloughs off the paint, creating a barrage that blinds Morrow's Green Lantern long enough for the Flash to deliver the knockout blow. Using the power ring, the Flash cages Morrow's Green Lantern, then heads to London. In New York, Green Lantern engages his evil twin.</p><p>Morrow's Green Lantern fires off spheres of yellow energy, that will explode on contact. Green Lantern dives for the Hudson River, parting the waters with the power of his ring. With the energy spheres in pursuit, Green Lantern swiftly surfaces, while releasing the river's walls of water. The energy spheres explode harmlessly beneath the river's surface. Green Lantern rams the base of the Statue of Liberty, driving it upwards, into his twin, knocking Morrow's Green Lantern out. After caging his opponent with his power ring, Green Lantern heads to London. Encountering the Flash en route, Green Lantern uses his power ring to create a more stable platform for the Flash to run on. The two heroes encounter Morrow's Green Lantern, as he flees across the rooftops of London.</p><p>Morrow's Green Lantern fires a power ring generated projectile at the Flash, then swats the Green Lantern out of the sky. The Green Lantern lands in the river Thames, which Morrow's Green Lantern transforms into quicksand. Vibrating at super-speed, the Flash allows the projectile to harmlessly pass through him. The Green Lantern uses his power ring to lift the Flash into the sky, to confront Morrow's Green lantern. As soon as the Flash is held in the power ring constructed hand, though, the Green Lantern stands up in the quicksand, revealing that he is actually one of Morrow's Green Lanterns. Suddenly, a power ring constructed rope appears to pull the Flash away from Morrow's Green Lanterns. It is the real Green Lantern.</p><p>In New York, Morrow's Green Lantern used his power ring to enslave Green Lantern's mind, then forced him to cage himself. Then he stole Green Lantern's power ring, so that he could not escape. Morrow's Green Lantern then rendezvoused with the Flash. However, creating the power-ring runway for Flash to race along gave him away. Only one of Morrow's Green Lantern's yellow-resistant ring constructs would have remained stable, while in contact with the Flash's yellow boots. The Flash willed the ring he took off of Morrow's Green Lantern, in Paris, to seek out the real Green Lantern, in New York. Green Lantern used the power-ring to free himself, then journey to London, and the Flash's rescue. Suddenly, Morrow's Green Lanterns dissipate into thin air.</p><p>Green Lantern uses his power ring to command the Morrow power ring to lead them to Morrow. The two heroes storm Morrow's laboratory complex, only to run headlong into a trap. The Green Lantern throws a shield around himself, and the Flash, to protect them from Morrow's laser gauntlet. Spying Morrow's duplicator, the Flash realizes that Morrow, himself, is a duplicate. The Flash throws the lever to erase the Morrow duplicate. The lever, though, has been booby-trapped. The Flash and the Green Lantern are caught in the center of an explosion. With the two heroes seemingly slain, the real Morrow comes out of hiding.

A young boy, Tommy Davis, presents a machine he built that he claims can accurately predict the weather. He tells the gathered crowd that according to his machine it will snow that afternoon. The audience laughs at him, since it's late June and it's forecasted to be over 90 degrees in the shade. Tommy insists his prediction is accurate.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Weather Wizard (civilian name Mark Mardon) causes snow to blanket the area surrounding Central City Bank to aid him in a robbery. With the snow blocking any police response, he's able to escape with the money.</p><p>Iris gets word of the freak snowstorm and bails on her lunch date with Barry Allen (secretly The Flash) in order to report on the story. She flags down The Flash and informs him of Tommy Davis' weather machine's accurate prediction.</p><p>Allen introduces himself to young Tommy and requests his help tracking down the criminal at large. Tommy agrees and informs the Scarlet Speedster that Central City will experience extremely dense fog the next day.<br /><br />The Flash is able to track down the Weather Wizard the next day by following the fog, but he's unable to prevent the thief from robbing a local jewelry store. Allen returns to Tommy Davis to receive his weather prediction for the next day. The machine is not currently picking up any signs of unusual weather activity. Davis gives Allen a walkie-talkie so he can inform the hero immediately if there's any change. </p><p>Several days later, Barry Allen receives a transmission from Tommy saying his machine indicated an unusual thunderhead cloud before the instruments went completely haywire. Next morning, The Flash is able to catch Weather Wizard in the act of attempting to rob the estate of millionaire Jason Trumbull, who collects the crown jewels of fallen kingdoms, but not before the villain destroys some of the bricks that make up the manor home. Irritated at being interrupted yet again by the hero, Mardon uses his weather wand to cover The Flash in the powdered remains of the bricks and buffets him with wind until he's almost completely petrified. Unfortunately for the thief, the dust is flung back at him so quickly and forcefully he passes out. <br /><br />After taking Mardon to jail, The Flash explains to Iris West how he was able to escape the villain's ""instant weathering"" technique. He was able to vibrate his atoms to protect himself from the dust's effect, then vibrated at ultra-speed to fling it back at the Weather Wizard.<br /><br />Later, The Flash and Iris visit Tommy Davis again to tell him how his machine was able to accurately predict the Weather Wizard's next move. The thief had pre-tested his weather wand every day before committing his crimes to ensure it would do exactly what he needed it to. Iris informs Tommy that she never mentioned him in her articles about The Flash's attempts to stop the Weather Wizard out of fear the dastardly villain may take drastic measures to stop the boy from aiding the Scarlet Speedster. The Flash follows up by telling Davis that now that Weather Wizard is behind bars, Tommy's about to get all the publicity he can take. The next day Tommy Davis receives a key to the city and a scholarship award for his science project. </p><h3> <span>The Girl From The Super-Fast Dimension!</span></h3><p>The Flash is astonished when a young girl taps him on the shoulder, while he is running at super-speed. The girl, Doralla Kon, is from the planet Alkomar, in a neighboring dimension. En route to the planet Sthantor, Kon accidentally ended up in Central City. From her perspective, the denizens of Central City seemed to be living statues. After the Flash teaches Kon how to slow her vibratory speed, she is able to interact normally with the populace. The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, offers to show Kon around the city. They are joined by Allen's girlfriend, Picture News reporter, Iris West, who, at first, is jealous of Kon, but quickly warms to her.</p><p>While standing before a fountain, an explosion rocks the city. Criminals are quick to take advantage of the devastation. Allen, as the Flash, rounds up all the looters, with an assist from Kon. Crossing a bridge in Central City park, the city is rocked by another explosion. Allen investigates as the Flash, but again, can find no cause for the blast. Another explosion follows when Allen, West and Kon cross a small body of water. Allen begins to suspect the truth. Allen and Kon see a shimmering haze form, surrounding the lake. Kon recognizes the haze as the precursor to an electro-magnetic explosion.</p><p>Unable to penetrate the barrier, Allen, as the Flash, runs up and over it, to reach the children trapped within it's perimeter. The Flash tosses the children to Kon, who then races them away from the barrier, before it explodes. To escape the explosion, the Flash tunnels underneath the barrier. From inside the barrier, the Flash could see a shimmering aura surrounding Kon. By slowing down her vibratory rate to interact with the citizens of Central City, Kon inadvertently created the aura about her. Said aura reacted explosively whenever Kon was near water. To prevent further explosions in Central City, Kon returns to Alkomar, leaving the Flash to wonder if he will ever see her again.</p>",,,,,,,False,7134,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4404349-145.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",145,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Weather Wizard Blows Up A Storm!; The Girl From The Super-Fast Dimension!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57175/', 'id': 57175, 'name': ""Weather Wizard's Wand"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/weather-wizards-wand/4055-57175/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-145-the-weather-wizard-blows-up-a-storm-/4000-7134/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Allen's girlfriend, Picture News Reporter Iris West, meets him, on graduation day, to make plans for lunch. West makes it clear she'll be satisfied by nothing less than Allen graduating at the top of his class. Allen's mind, however, is focused more on the recent news of the Mirror Master's escape from prison. Unbeknownst to Allen, the Mirror Master is actually one of his classmates, in Dobill's success course.</p><p>Using Dobill's guiding principles of success, the Mirror Master has been enjoying his most successful crime spree ever. Unable to contain himself any longer, the Mirror Master uses the mirrors in his special glasses to place the entire class in a trance. Moving to the front of the room, the Mirror Master addresses the class, boasting of the details of his latest crime. Interrupted mid-robbery by a night watchman, the Mirror Master dodged the guard's gunfire, before subduing him with a mirror weapon.</p><p>Encountering the Flash during the getaway, the Mirror Master unveiled his newest mirror weapon. After a blinding flash, the Mirror Master's legs were, inexplicably, swapped with the Flash's. Now able to run at super-speed, the Mirror Master fled. Running along on his hands, the Flash is able to catch up with the Mirror Master, and surround him in a super-speed generated whirlwind. The Mirror Master makes a break for it, then doubles back and clocks the Flash, knocking him out.</p><p>Another blinding flash from his mirror weapon, restores the Mirror Master's legs to him. Finished boasting of his criminal prowess, the Mirror Master retakes his seat, and releases the class from their trance. Very quickly, Dobill, Allen, and the rest of the class, realize they've experienced an entire hour of lost time. Allen takes note that the classmate sitting on his left, really the Mirror Master, has an empty ashtray at his desk. The ashtray on Dobill's desk has four cigarette butts extinguished in it, the exact number Allen's classmate usually smokes during class.</p><p>Studying his classmate's face, Allen sees through his disguise, and recognizes him as the Mirror Master. Moving faster than the eye can see, Allen uses the Mirror Master's glasses to put the class back in a trance. Quickly dodging the Mirror Master's attack, Allen punches the Mirror Master into unconsciousness. For solving the mystery of the classes' trance, and capturing the notorious Mirror Master, Dobill graduates Allen at the top of his class. A fact West takes great delight in, during their lunch date.</p><h3><ins>Fatal Fingers Of The Flash!</ins></h3><p>Using his Cosmic Treadmill, the Flash journey's into the far future, to the day the Earth died. The Flash finds the Earth a barren wasteland, devoid of life. His scientific curiosity draws him to several pools of liquid metal. Removing his gloves, the Flash finds the metal to have the feel and consistency of Mercury. As the sun begins to nova, the Flash takes several photographs. Relaxing his inner vibrations, the Flash returns to the present.</p><p>As Police Forensics Scientist Barry Allen, the Flash had been dining with his girlfriend, Picture News Reporter, Iris West. It was there that West revealed that she had written an article on the end of the world, after interviewing astronomer Coblentz Stanton. Professor Stanton had determined the exact moment the Earth's sun would go nova, destroying the world. Allen offered West the Flash's aid, in getting pictures of the Earth's last moments.</p><p>Upon returning to the present, the Flash finds his gloves disintegrating. Touching a table in his laboratory causes it to decay in a matter of seconds. The Flash experiments with several objects, and gets the same results. Coming into contact with the pool of liquid metal, has given him the uncontrollable power to rapidly age anything he touches. En route to find help for his condition, the Flash encounters a police chase.</p><p>The Flash runs down the criminal's car, and slaps all four wheels. The tires become brittle, and shatter. When the first crook exits the car, the Flash slams him back with a super-speed generated blast of compressed air. Still moving at extreme velocity, the Flash heats the air enough to melt the asphalt around the second crook's feet, then rapidly cools it, adhering his shoes to the road.</p><p>The Flash takes out the final crook by running around a pear tree at super-speed, and drawing the pears into his wake. Charging the last crook standing, the Flash drops down low, allowing the pears to rush past him at high velocity, and batter the crook into unconsciousness. Crossing a bridge, the Flash spies two young boys struggling in the river's rapids.</p><p>The Flash dives in, and has the boys grab his legs, as he swims them back to shore. After chastising the boys for not wearing life jackets, the Flash finally makes it to the research institute. The scientists there are baffled by the Flash's condition. Acting as if the Flash had been poisoned, the scientists have the Flash decay a bag of oats, then consume them. The decaying oats create an aging anti-toxin in the Flash's bloodstream, curing him of his rapid aging touch. In gratitude for procuring the photographs for her, West offers to take the Flash to dinner.</p><h3> </h3>",,,,,,,False,7228,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4404348-146.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",146,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Mirror Master's Master Stroke!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3493/', 'id': 3493, 'name': 'Frank Giacoia', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-giacoia/4040-3493/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-146-the-mirror-master-s-master-stroke/4000-7228/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Desmond once terrorized Central City as both the villainous Mr. Element, as well as the nefarious Doctor Alchemy. Having paid his debt to society, Desmond has reformed. At dinner, Desmond complains of a sudden headache, and departs for home. Trancelike, he finds himself, instead, returning to his criminal lair. Uncovering his old laboratory equipment, Desmond mixes up a batch of chemicals, with volatile results. As the smoke clears, Desmond finds himself facing Professor Zoom, the Reverse Flash. Having taken control of Desmond's mind, Professor Zoom telepathically explains his presence in the 20th century.</p><p>After losing the Flash costume that gave him his incredible super-speed, Professor Zoom became obsessed with regaining his powers. Professor Zoom discovered an element, that he dubbed ""Element Z"", that gave him super-human speed. Element Z, however, proved to be too unstable to maintain his powers for more than a few moments. Searching the history books, Professor Zoom learned that Desmond is the only chemist brilliant enough to stabilize Element Z. Desmond, though, refuses. His brilliance is too tied to the criminal side of his mind. Undeterred, Professor Zoom telepathically forces Desmond to don his Mr. Element costume, and to resume his criminal career. Desmond, as Mr. Element, strikes at the Egyptian Museum, intent on stealing the Horus Scarab.</p><p>After taking out the guards with a block of pure sodium, Mr. Element reaches for the Horus Scarab, but finds he cannot take it. The Flash arrives on the scene, crestfallen to discover that Desmond has resumed his criminal career. Mr. Element stops the Flash with a web of crystal iron, which impedes the Scarlet Speedster's forward motion, before snapping him back, hard, into the wall. When the Flash revives, Mr. Element is gone, but the Horus Scarab remains. Mr. Element returns to Professor Zoom empty-handed. Professor Zoom doubles his efforts to return Mr. Element to his criminal ways. Mr. Element is commanded to rob the Federal Treasury building. Mr. Element uses heated zirconium to literally burn through the brick walls of the treasury building.</p><p>This time, Mr. Element does take the loot, but, still resisting Professor Zoom's mind control, he walks very slowly back to the hideout. The Flash closes in on Mr. Element, at the exact same moment that Professor Zoom is racing to his aid. The two super-speedsters violently collide with one another. Professor Zoom recovers first, and lays the Flash out with a telepathic force blast. Resigned to the fact that Professor Zoom has once more made him a criminal, Mr. Element sets about to stabilizing Element Z. As Professor Zoom had hoped, Mr. Element is successful in purifying and stabilizing Element Z. Wearing Element Z in a necklace around his neck, Professor Zoom is thrilled to regain his super-speed powers.</p><p>Having gotten what he wanted, Professor Zoom takes his leave of Mr. Element. Following the residual trail the Flash leaves, when moving at super-speed, Professor Zoom tracks down the Flash's Cosmic Treadmill, to return to his era. The Flash arrives just as Professor Zoom fades away. Without wasting a moment, the Flash pursues Professor Zoom, into the future. Professor Zoom issues the government an ultimatum, to pay him a billion in credits, lest he uses his powers to release every single criminal from the world's prisons. To prove his threat, Professor Zoom releases an old convict buddy, Foxy. Learning of Professor Zoom's scheme, the Flash begins patrolling prisons, until he encounters his adversary.</p><p>An epic battle ensues, with each combatant moving at incredible velocity. Ultimately, the Flash's greater super-speed experience wins the day. With the Element Z removed from Professor Zoom's necklace, the Reverse Flash finds himself without powers anew. After Professor Zoom has been incarcerated, the Flash returns to his proper era, The Flash learns that Mr. Element returned all of the stolen money. Once the Flash has revealed that Mr. Element was the helpless victim of Professor Zoom, criminal charges are dropped. Allen and West join Desmond, and his fiancee, again, for dinner. Desmond voices his fears of having another ""headache"". With Professor Zoom safely behind bars in the 25th Century, Allen knows those fears are groundless.</p><h4><strong>Notes:</strong></h4><ul><li>The cover is a homage to the cover of <em><a href=""/the-flash-123-flash-of-two-worlds/4000-5443/"" data-ref-id=""4000-5443"">The Flash #123</a></em>.</li><li><p>This comic book appeared in the movie <em>Catch Me if You Can</em>.</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,7279,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/6668-1995-7279-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",147,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","Our Enemy, the Flash!","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-147-our-enemy-the-flash/4000-7279/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Using an exploding boomerang, Captain Boomerang opens the safe, only to find it empty, save for a note. Once more, the Crooked Four have beaten him to a crime. Back in his hidden lair, Captain Boomerang stews over the Crooked Four's constant one-upmanship at every crime he's tried to commit.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Captain Boomerang, the leader of the Crooked Four is a man named Fanning, Captain Boomerang's old prison cellmate. Fanning, along with other like-minded convicts, is out to take Captain Boomerang down a peg, in response to Captain Boomerang's enormous ego, not to mention his disdainful arrogance. Using subliminal suggestion, Fanning steers Captain Boomerang into committing specific crimes at specific times. All so Fanning's gang can beat him to the punch every time.</p><p>Fanning's gang, however, is interrupted by the Flash, during their next robbery. Though the Flash is able to easily dodge the gang's gunfire, an errant sheet of paper creases his temple, rendering him unconscious. Fanning, and his men, are about to execute the Flash, when Captain Boomerang attacks them. Captain Boomerang swiftly disarms Fanning, and his gang, but stops short upon recognizing Fanning. Before Captain Boomerang can fully process Fanning's involvement, Fanning, and his men escape.</p><p>Fanning steers Captain Boomerang to his next crime, but also tips off the police. Fanning and his gang set up across the street, to watch Captain Boomerang's inevitable arrest. The Flash closes on Fanning's gang, and uses super-compressed air pressure to knock them all out. Spying the heavy police presence, Captain Boomerang flees the scene, with the Flash hot on his trail. Captain Boomerang leads the Flash to a boomerang shaped bridge. Crossing the bridge, the Flash is stuck midway, by a powerful adhesive.</p><p>The boomerang launches into the air, heading for orbit. As the Flash approaches the Himalayas, he vibrates his molecules at super-speed, to angle the boomerang down at Mount Everest. Grasping the flagpole, of the American flag planted at the summit, the Flash holds on until the boomerang tears free from his boots. Catching up with Captain Boomerang, the Flash swiftly returns his old foe to prison. Once again, Captain Boomerang finds himself sharing a cell with Fanning. Captain Boomerang demands to know how Fanning got the best of him, but Fanning says nothing.</p><h3><ins>The Doorway To The Unknown!</ins></h3><p>Returning from his evening patrol, the Flash finds a man waiting for him in his apartment. The man identifies himself as Fred Dalmon, the Vice President of a bank in Arizona City. Dalmon has spent the last 8 years embezzling funds from the bank. When auditors began to get suspicious, Dalmon framed one of the tellers, David Dean. En route to Central City, to start a new life, Dalmon learns that a prison breakout has occurred. Four vicious criminals have taken Dean hostage, to learn the location of the missing money. Fearing Dean's untimely demise for a crime he didn't commit, Dalmon has approached the Flash to set things right.</p><p>Having made his plea, Dalmon vanishes into thin air right before the Flash's eyes. Though startled, the Flash wastes no time in running to Arizona City. Quickly ferreting out the gang of convicts, the Flash beats them all into unconsciousness. After the Flash reveals that he knows Dean was framed, Dean asks the Flash to help his kid brother, Jack. After Dean's wrongful conviction, his brother lost faith in the system and fell in with a group of criminals. Dean asks the Flash to stop his brother from following a path into a life of crime. The Flash intervenes, and after pulling Jack Dean to safety, takes down young Dean's would-be criminal peers.</p><p>After taking the crooks to jail, the Flash sits down with the younger Dean and sets him back on the straight and narrow. The warden agrees to release David Dean, if the Flash can bring Dalman to justice. Returning to Central City, the Flash is astonished to learn that Dalman was killed in a car accident. In fact, Dalmon died at exactly midnight, the moment he vanished before the Flash's eyes. With the money recovered, Dean is released from prison. Though shaken by his brush with the supernatural, the Flash believes that, in death, Dalton has redeemed himself.</p>",,,,,,,False,7397,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/6779-1995-7397-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",148,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55753/', 'id': 55753, 'name': 'Arizona', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/arizona/4020-55753/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55810/', 'id': 55810, 'name': 'Himalayas', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/himalayas/4020-55810/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-57958/', 'id': 57958, 'name': 'Mount Everest', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mount-everest/4020-57958/'}]",The Day Flash Went Into Orbit!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58438/', 'id': 58438, 'name': ""Captain Boomerang's Boomerangs"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-boomerangs-boomerangs/4055-58438/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-148-the-day-flash-went-into-orbit/4000-7397/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Wally West investigates, as Kid Flash. Discovering a massive crater on the edge of town, Kid Flash explores it's interior. Suddenly, Kid Flash is caught in powerful vortex, that draws him, ever deeper. into the crater. Word of West's disappearance makes headlines across the country. Mysterious explosions continue to occur across the world. The Flash comes to Blue Valley, to personally investigate his protege's disappearance. After spending the entire day searching, the Flash returns to his laboratory in Central City. There, he finds Kid Flash waiting for him. The vortex had drawn Kid Flash across dimensional space, to the alien world, Ikora. Kid Flash learned that a band of criminals, the K-10 Gang, had been using a new explosive to commit crimes.</p><p>While the explosive's effects were considerable on Ikora, the force, as it breached the dimensional barrier between Ikora and Earth, was exponentially more powerful. Kid Flash ran down the K-10 Gang, in the act of committing another crime. In hot pursuit of the fleeing criminals, Kiid Flash was winged by the their blaster fire. Though not seriously injured, it occurred to Kid Flash that, were he to be killed, no one on Earth would ever learn the truth about the mysterious explosions. Immediately, Kid Flash returned to Earth, to enlist the aid of his mentor, the Flash. Having finished his tale, Kid Flash suddenly passes out. When the Flash revives him, he finds Kid Flash suffering from amnesia, a delayed result of the hit he took on Ikora.</p><p>The Flash carries Kid Flash to the sites of some of their past adventures, but Kid Flash remembers nothing. Taking Kid Flash, as West, to see a doctor, the Flash learns that a sudden shock might cause West's memory to return. The Flash returns West to his parents. Taking note of the television show they are watching, the Flash races to the television studio, and then reveals his identity on live television. The shock of the Flash's unmasking restores West's memories. Rendezvousing with the Flash, West, as Kid Flash, leads his mentor to Ikora. Scouring Ikora, the Scarlet Speedsters run down the K-10 Gang. After disarming them, the Flash and Kid Flash beat them into unconsciousness, with a bit of super-speed maneuvering. With the authorities' assurance that the explosive will never be used again, the Scarlet Speedsters return to Earth.</p><h3><ins>Robberies By Magic!</ins></h3><p>Returning to Central City, the Flash feels a sharp tingle. Spying a gang of fleeing criminals, the Flash has no time to focus on the strange sensation. Racing after the crooks' getaway car, the Flash suddenly slips on a pool of oil. Resuming the chase, the Flash then runs headlong into a wall of Earth. By the time he recovers, the criminals have mad good their escape. At police headquarters, the Flash receives a note from his nemesis, Abra Kadabra. The magical miscreant taunts the Flash, daring him to stop his ""one-a-day"" robberies. Abra Kadabra even going so far as to tell the Flash where and when the next crime will take place. In his secret lair, Abra Kadabra instructs his criminal gang to leave another note for the Flash, at the scene of their next crime.</p><p>Once more the Flash engages the band of crooks. Every tactic he uses to catch them, though, completely backfires on him. Reading the note Abra Kadabra left for him, the Flash learns where he can find his foe. En route to Abra Kadabra's lair, the Flash soon finds himself beset by all manner of ills. First his legs sink into the road. Launching himself into the air, the Flash finds he cannot control his ascent. Then, he suddenly veers in the direction of Abra Kadabra's chateau. The Flash crashes into the room. Recovering quickly, he launches himself against Abra Kadabra. Every attack he makes, though, causes the Flash to suffer improbably. Finally, Abra Kadabra reveals the trick.</p><p>He has transferred his own magic into the Flash, but hexed it so that the Flash will always suffer bad luck when he uses his super-speed. Abra Kadabra offers to teach the Flash how to use magic to capture criminals, in exchange for the Flash's super-speed. The Flash refuses, then begins punching every square inch of space in the room. Though he ultimately knocks himself unconscious, his tactic does also bring down Abra Kadabra. Reviving quicker than his foe, the Flash uses Abra Kadabra's transference machine to transfer his magical powers out of the Flash, and into a lamp. Abra Kadabra is returned to prison, while the Flash ponders what to do with his magic lamp.</p>",,,,,,,False,7455,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/6835-1995-7455-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",149,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Flash's Sensational Risk!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-149-the-flash-s-sensational-risk/4000-7455/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

This detail doesn't sit well with Allen's girlfriend, Picture News Reporter, Iris West. In love with the Maharanee, the notorious Captain Cold sets out to win her heart. Allen is sent to the Horvath Jewel Salon to collect the Maharanee's royal jewels. Allen finds the salon surrounded by icicles. Allen takes action, as the Flash. Vibrating at super-speed, the Flash storms the salon, melting his way through the ice barrier.</p><p>Captain Cold uses his cold gun to, inexplicably, liquefy the oxygen in the salon, causing the Flash to drown. Moving at super-speed, the Flash evaporates the water into steam. The Flash fans the steam throughout the salon, melting all the ice, which floors Captain Cold in a torrent of rushing water. As the melting ice begins to fall from the ceiling, it collapses on the Flash, knocking him cold. Gathering the royal jewels, Captain Cold makes good his escape.</p><p>When the Flash, as Allen, returns to the Maharanee to report the theft of the jewels, he is stunned to find her adorned with them. Captain Cold has sent the jewels to her, with the expectation of receiving a reward. Allen escorts the Maharanee to the Grand Ball, only to see her suddenly vanish into thin air. In truth, the Maharanee has been kidnapped by Captain Cold, posing as Allen. Captain Cold brings the Maharanee to the Central City Sports Arena, where he bids her to take the throne he has created for her.</p><p>Using his Cold Gun, Captain Cold creates a spectacle for the Maharanee's entertainment. Realizing that Captain Cold created an illusion of the Maharanee, Allen gets after him, as the Flash. The Flash storms the arena. Captain Cold defends himself with a Cold Gun generated Frost Giant, coupled with a Northern Lights-like electrical field. Vibrating faster then the speed of light, the Flash escapes Captain Cold's ersatz Aurora Borealis, as well as the grip of the Frost Giant.</p><p>Caught in the Cold Gun's sights, the Flash moves so fast that while Captain Cold is firing on his after-image, the Flash is actually behind his foe, beating him into unconsciousness. With Captain Cold turned over to the authorities, the Flash offers to escort the Maharanee to the Grand Ball. After taking a few turns on the dance floor, the Flash ""departs"" so that, as Allen, he may dance with his fiance, West.</p><h3><ins>The Touch And Steal Bandits!</ins></h3><p>The Flash attempts to discover his top speed. Circling the Earth 75 times in one second, the Flash attains a velocity ten times the speed of light. Though potentially able to go even faster, muscle fatigue forces him to decrease his velocity. At work the next day, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, notices a strange ringing in his ears. The ringing persists, until Allen realizes that he is actually reading the minds of the men around him. Of particular note, are the thoughts of two criminals planning a caper. Allen, as the Flash, easily thwarts their crime.</p><p>At police headquarters, the Flash notices that he can no longer read the minds of the two criminals. His telepathic powers seem fine in every other respect. The next morning, the Flash, as Allen, learns that the two crooks escaped police custody. Apparently, they were able to telekinetically draw their guns to them, then forced the guard, at gunpoint, to release them. Somehow, the Flash passed on psychic abilities to the two crooks, when he captured them. On their houseboat hideaway, the two crooks attempt to telekinetically draw money and jewelry to them, to no avail.</p><p>They quickly determine that they can only move objects that they have already touched. Over the next several days, the criminal pair visit several jewelry stores, and art gallerys, laying hands on everything they desire. Soon, precious objects can be seen floating through the streets of Central City, as they are drawn to the crooks' hands. The Flash follows a necklace to the crook's lair. Upon boarding the boat, the Flash is bombarded by a swarm of pots and pans. Capturing the cookware in the wake of his super-speed, the Flash tows it along behind him, to pelt the crooks.</p><p>As he closes on them, a door suddenly slams in his face, causing the Flash to take the hit from the cookware. The Flash vibrates his way through the door, only to be enveloped in a rug. Suddenly, a davenport collides with the Flash. Stunned, the Flash is drawn into a chair, which then rockets towards the ceiling. Vibrating his molecules into intangibility, the Flash passes harmlessly through the ceiling, then doubles back into the room. After beating the two crooks into unconsciousness, the Flash races around the world in reverse to build up enough negative energy to counter his psychic abilities. Grounding himself on the crooks, the Flash erases their telekinetic abilities, as well as his own telepathic ones.</p><h3> </h3>",,,,,,,False,7585,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/6940-1995-7585-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",150,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",Captain Cold's Polar Perils!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-150-captain-cold-s-polar-perils/4000-7585/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

As Inez prepares to mount the rocking horse, it launches itself into the sky. Allen pursues the rocking horse, and spies the Trickster closing on it. The Trickster mounts the rocking horse, and proceeds onward to a floating art gallery, housed in a dirigible. Allen, as the Flash, generates a tornado, that he then rides up to the dirigible. The Trickster emerges, his saddle bags filled with rare canvases. To distract the Flash from capturing him, the Trickster destroys the dirigible, endangering the lives of the art patrons trapped inside the cabin.</p><p>By the time the Flash has safely lowered the cabin to the ground, on a super-speed generated cushion of compressed air, the Trickster has made good his escape. The Flash, as Allen, revisits the toy store where he purchased the rocking horse. There, Allen learns that the Trickster made two other purchases, which means two more crimes are in the offing. The first of these crimes occurs at sea, where the Trickster, riding a jet-powered surfboard, robs a luxury liner. To distract the Flash from capturing him, the Trickster uses his jets to kick up an enormous tidal wave. The Flash evacuates the liner, carrying all of it's passengers to shore, before the wave capsizes the vessel.</p><p>Once again, though, the Trickster has made good his escape. The Flash, as Allen, spends the next day in his laboratory, preparing for his next encounter with the Trickster. Alerted by police bulletin that the Trickster has just robbed a bank, Allen, as the Flash, races after his foe. With dollar bills trailing behind him, the Trickster flees on a motorized tricycle. As the Flash closes on the Trickster, he finds himself being repelled backwards. Undeterred, the Flash hurls magnetized thumb tacks at the the Trickster's tricycle, immobilizing it. Tearing off the tricycle's horn, the Trickster uses it to envelop the Flash in a smoke screen.</p><p>The Flash easily disperses the noxious cloud, by waving his arms at super-speed. The Trickster then ensnares the Flash with the rubber of the tricycle's wheels, but again the Flash is able to quickly free himself. The Trickster reveals that the tricycle's handlebars fire armor-piercing needles. The Flash dodges the Tricksters assault, retaliating with a barrage of paper money planes, hurled at high velocity. Unwilling to destroy the money to defend himself, the Trickster hesitates, allowing the Flash to punch him into unconsciousness. Allen and West buy Inez a new rocking horse, but Inez is upset when she discovers that it doesn't fly.</p><h3><ins>Case Of The Explosive Vegetables!</ins></h3><p>Professor West is en route to Central City, to unveil his latest scientific invention. Absentmindedly, West shows up at the wrong address, a safe house for Communist spies. Playing along with West's misperception, the spies allow him to demonstrate his latest discovery, the protocon ray. Bathing a bowl of grapes with protocon radiation, West causes the grapes to grow to colossal proportions. Immediately seeing the obvious use for such a device, the spies abduct West. Searching for the missing scientist, the Flash tracks West down, at the Communist safe house. The Flash is seconds away from taking down the spies, when one of the enormous grapes falls to the floor and explodes.</p><p>Though able to vibrate fast enough to cause most of the the explosive force to pass harmlessly through him, the Flash is, nonetheless, knocked unconscious. The spies take the opportunity to flee, with West. Upon reviving, the Flash catches up with the spies, at sea. The spies hold the Flash at bay, by threatening to murder West. The absentminded professor surreptitiously activates the protocon ray, enlarging a bowl of fruit. That brief moment's distraction is all the Flash needs to beat down the entire spy ring. The Flash escorts West to the Science Conference. Sadly, the absentminded West can no longer remember how to activate the protocon ray.</p>",,,,,,,False,7753,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7082-1995-7753-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",152,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",The Trickster's Toy Thefts!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58442/', 'id': 58442, 'name': ""Trickster's Gadgets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tricksters-gadgets/4055-58442/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-152-the-trickster-s-toy-thefts/4000-7753/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-56975/', 'id': 56975, 'name': 'Communists', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/communists/4060-56975/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

A psychic scan has indicated that Thawne is completely reformed. In truth, Thawne tampered with the test to get the desired results. While in prison, Thawne envisioned an entirely new branch of science, one dedicated to the study of Ultra-Speed. The first device Thawne creates, using the principles of Ultra-Speed, is a machine that causes the evil side of one's nature to become dominant. Having successfully tested the machine on laboratory animals, Thawne sets his sights on Al Desmond. A brilliant chemist, Desmond was once the notorious Mister Element.</p><p>Having served his time, Desmond tried to put his past behind him. Thawne tried, once before, to set Demond back down the path towards evil. Now, Thawne intends to try again. Thawne projects the machine's radiation, 500 years into the past. Desmond is in his supervisor's office, about to accept a promotion, when he feels the effects of the radiation. Immediately, he calls his friend, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, and asks him to dinner. Desmond begs Allen to contact the Flash. Allen exits the restaurant, then returns, as the Flash. Desmond tries to rob the restaurant, but the Flash hauls him out before the crime can really get started.</p><p>The Flash offers to aid Desmond, but Desmond turns on him. Taking the Flash by surprise, Desmond punches the Flash unconscious. Desmond returns to his old criminal lair, and puts on his Mister Element costume. All it once, Desmond shakes off the irresistible criminal urges that overcame him. Thawne is unable to keep the machine's radiation focused on Desmond. As it passes through time, the radiation begins to spread out. Suddenly, Central City is awash in criminal activity. The Flash rounds up the would-be criminals, handing them off to the police. Unable to narrow the radiation beam to just Desmond, Thawne travels back in time, himself, along with his Ultra Speed machines.</p><p>Using a Cosmic Treadmill of his own design, Thawne returns to the Central City of 1965, as Professor Zoom. Using his ability to dominate the minds of men, Professor Zoom forces Central City's Municipal Council to outlaw super-speed travel within city limits. So steadfast is his belief in the law, the Flash refuses to run at super-speed, despite Professor Zoom's taunting. Professor Zoom even goes so far as to rob a bank right before the Flash's eyes, but the Flash makes no super-speed move to stop him. Vibrating his molecules into intangibility, the Flash slips below the streets of Central City.</p><p>Professor Zoom tracks the Flash down, just as he exits a tunnel, leading up from Central City's underground. Suddenly, the Flash lunges at Professor Zoom, once more using his super-speed powers. The Flash directs Professor Zooms's eyes over to the city limits sign. Professor Zoom, spinning at high velocity, breaks free of the Flash's grip, and races back across the city line. The Flash builds up a battering ram of compressed air, that floors Professor Zoom. The Reverse Flash recovers, though, too quickly for the Flash to take advantage of the situation. Desmond watches their battle, desperate to help the Flash, but still wrestling with Professor Zoom's evil impulses.</p><p>Professor Zoom defeats the Flash, and renders him helpless with ultra-radiation. From a monitor screen in his hidden lair, Professor Zoom forces the Flash to watch Desmond, as Mister Element, resume his criminal career. Professor Zoom leads Mister Element to his secret lair, then offers him the opportunity to murder the Flash. Mister Element takes aim, then fires at Professor Zoom's Ultra-Speed machine, freeing the Flash. Before Professor Zoom can react, the Flash knocks him unconscious. No longer consciously able to maintain his internal vibrations, Professor Zoom is drawn back to his own time. The Flash turns to thank Mister Element, only to have his former foe turn on him.</p><p>Prior to succumbing to Professor Zoom's evil impulses, Desmond had planted a post-hypnotic suggestion upon himself to aid the Flash on sight. Having done so, Desmond, as Mister Element, was now free to murder the Flash himself. Moving his arms at super-speed, the Flash blocks Mister Element's attack, while also knocking him unconscious. Using his own Cosmic Treadmill, the Flash carries Mister Element 500 years into the future. After learning that Professor Zoom has already been incarcerated, the Flash asks the scientists of the day to use their technology to reform Desmond. Cured of his criminal inclinations at last, Desmond accepts his promotion at work, and moves forward with his marriage plans, with his fiancee, Rita.</p>",,,,,,,False,7812,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7131-1995-7812-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",153,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Mightiest Punch Of All Time!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-153-the-mightiest-punch-of-all-time/4000-7812/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Scudder mysteriously appears in Central City Park, having seemingly traded places with the hapless civilian. Scudder immediately heads to a criminal tailor, to garner a new Mirror Master costume. At the tailor's, Scudder encounters five of his fellow rogues, Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Heatwave, the Pied Piper, and the Top. All five criminals share similar stories. They were all in prison, and then, suddenly, they weren't. The Mirror Master proposes that instead of going their separate ways, they pull off their next caper, as a team. All agree, then head off to collect their specialized weapons. Police Forensics Scientist, Barry Allen, hears a police bulletin regarding the robbery of the Gemfull Department Store, by Captain Cold.</p><p>Allen investigates, as the Flash. Arriving at the scene, the Flash finds the department store completely encased in ice. Vibrating his way inside, the Flash, unsurprisingly, encounters Captain Cold. Quickly, Captain Cold freezes the floor underneath the Flash's feet. His foreword motion stopped, the Flash is helpless as Captain Cold lowers his weapon, and fires upon the Flash.  Whirling his hands at incredible velocity, the Flash generates a buffer of super-heated air that melts Captain Cold's icy attack. The water is hurled back at Captain Cold, flooring him. Responding to sounds on the floor above him, the Flash discovers that the Mirror Master, and the Top, are in on the robbery.  The Top hurls a top that generates blinding light, as it spins, at the Flash, By waving his hands in front of his face, at super-speed, the Flash is able to cut through the glare.</p><p>Suddenly, the Flash appears on an oversized bowling lane, with a mammoth bowling ball coming right at him. No matter which way he zigs or zags, the bowling ball continues to bear down on him. Realizing the whole scenario must be one of the Mirror Master's illusions, the Flash runs right through the ball. The Flash is seconds away from taking down the Mirror Master and the Top, when the Pied Piper makes his presence known. Suddenly, the Flash finds himself forced to dance a jig, to the music of the Pied Piper's pipe. With herculean effort, the Flash manages to do a high dance kick, that knocks the pipe from the Pied Piper's hands. In rush Captain Boomerang and Heatwave, to take their shot at the Flash. The two felons begin arguing over who should attack first, giving the Flash the time to incapacitate them both.</p><p>In doing so, though, the Flash accidentally trips, leaving himself prone, and vulnerable to his rogues' gallery. The Rogues gather around the Flash and, in unison, blast him with their trademark weapons. When the smoke clears, the Flash appears to have been disintegrated. In reality, the Flash vibrated his molecules into intangibility, and passed, unseen, through the floor. With the Rogues gone, the Flash examines more closely a strange field of radiation he noticed, while battling against Captain Cold and the Pied Piper. The Flash tracks the radiation signature to a gorilla cage, at the Central City zoo. The zookeeper informs the Flash that the two gorillas, Freddy and Pola, were once deeply in love but, of late, Freddy has been spurning Pola's advances. Immediately suspecting the super-gorilla, Grodd, the Flash heads to Gorilla City.</p><p>There, the Flash finds all of the inhabitants  frozen, as if in a trance. Checking his prison, the Flash finds Grodd to be in the same trance. The Flash receives a weak telepathic message from Solovar, the King of Gorilla City. Solovar informs the Flash that Grodd has transferred his mind to a gorilla in Central City, and plans to use the soldiers of Gorilla City to mount an offensive against the world. The Flash returns to the Central City zoo, to find Freddy gone. Enlisting Pola's aid to track her mate down, the Flash quickly finds Grodd, at the Central City rail yards. Grodd teleports the Rogues to the rail yards, to run interference for him. The Flash charges the Rogues. The Flash moves past them so fast that, as they discharge their signature weapons, they end up taking each other out.  Having run the gauntlet to reach Grodd, the Flash finds that he has lost his super-speed.</p><p>Using the Rogues, Grodd has been suppressing the Flash's super-speed, little by little, at each encounter, with a power dampening radiation. Now, Grodd can keep the Flash's speed subdued with the power of his mind. Grodd lunges at the Flash, intent on murdering him. Pola, though, intervenes, believing that her mate Freddy, has spurned her for another ape. The distraction is enough to break Grodd's concentration over the Flash, restoring his super-speed. The Flash beats Grodd senseless, then races back to Gorilla City. With Grodd unconscious, the inhabitants of Gorilla City have regained their mobility.

Klkan demands the Flash be turned over to him, or the Earth will be destroyed. As a demonstration of his power, Klkan transforms everything into gold, and evolves a common house fly into a horrific creature. The Flash astonishes the entire world by refusing to surrender to the aliens. Klkan reveals the Flash's secret identity to the world, then gives the nations' governments 48 hours to produce the Flash. Wally West, as Kid Flash, travels from Blue Valley to Central City, to seek out his mentor. Kid Flash encounters Picture News reporter, Iris West, and tries to comfort her.</p><p>While Kid Flash scours Central City for the Flash, West returns home. She finds her fiancee, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, waiting for her. West is both relieved to see Allen, and furious that he has kept the secret of his Flash identity from her. Allen, as the Flash, catches up with Kid Flash. The Flash reveals the reason behind Klkan's presence on Earth. Klkan is a member of the aristocratic class on Gyr, known as a Drdon. Recently, the tyranny of the Drdons had been overthrown, by the populace, in a decisive confrontation, known as the ""Battle Of Gyr City"". Klkan proposed to travel back in time, to refight the ""Battle Of Gyr City"", and correct the mistakes that cost them the battle.</p><p>Klkan's time machine, however, needed an individual capable of achieving light speed velocity to power it. Klkan penetrates the Flash's mind with a single atom that contains the entire history of Gyr within it, as well as an overwhelming evil impulse to aid the Drdons. The Flash quickly learns that the Drdons' power of suggestion weakens the slower he runs. The Flash leads Kid Flash to a hidden laboratory where the Flash has been working on a neutralizing agent for the Drdons' atom-based mental dominance. With the deadline for Earth fast approaching, the Flash leaves the completion of the work to Kid Flash, then turns himself over to Klkan.</p><p>The Flash is teleported to Gyr, then installed as the power source for Klkan's time machine. The faster the Flash runs, the stronger his desire to aid the Drdons grows. Finally, Klkan, and his fellow Drdons, have returned to the ""Battle Of Gyr City"". The Flash watches helplessly as the Drdans. slowly but surely, begin to turn the tide of battle in their favor. Kid Flash completes the work on the Flash's nullifying device, and activates it. The Drdon atom in the Flash's brain is destroyed. Once again able to move at his highest velocity, without turning evil, the Flash routs Klkan's forces. The Drdons lose the ""Battle Of Gyr City"" again.</p><p>The Flash learns, from the ruling council of Gyr, that Earth is still in jeopardy. The moment the Flash was teleported off Earth, a chain reaction began that, left unchecked, will destroy the Earth. The Flash is given a chemical compound to stifle the chain reaction, then teleported back to Earth. Rendezvousing with Kid Flash, the Scarlet Speedsters crisscross the entire globe, coating it with the chemical compound. The crisis past, the Flash is left with one loose thread to address, the revelation of his secret identity to the world. Conferring with his fiancee, the Flash proposes to use Gyr technology to turn time back on Earth, to the point just prior to Klkan's revelation.</p><p>Though West is reluctant to lose the knowledge of Allen's dual life, she supports his intentions, agreeing that it's for the greater good. The Flash builds a planet size cosmic treadmill, and runs the world back in time, erasing all knowledge of his dual identity. The confirmation that his plan has worked comes at his next dinner date with West. Chastising him from being late, West goes on a mini-tirade about Allen's laziness and lack of ambition, dramatically re-enforcing that the status quo of their relationship has not changed.</p>",,,,,,,False,8139,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7393-1995-8139-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",156,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56629/', 'id': 56629, 'name': 'United Nations Headquarters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/united-nations-headquarters/4020-56629/'}]",The super-Hero who betrayed the world!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-156-the-super-hero-who-betrayed-the-worl/4000-8139/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Allen changes into his Flash costume to confront the imposter. Allen has difficulty getting into costume, then knocks himself out, running into the wall. Dazed and sprawled on the floor, the Flash realizes he's lost his super-speed powers. The Flash decides to confront the imposter anyway, as Allen. Arriving at the offices of Picture News, Allen is introduced to the Flash by West. At West's request, the Flash completes three feats of super-speed. Allan is amazed to discover that this Flash's super-speed surpasses his own.</p><p>Back at police headquarters, Allen finds a mysterious woman waiting for him. It is Doralla Kon, an extra-dimensional alien from the planet Alkomar, a world where everyone possesses super-speed. It is Kon who has stolen Allen's super-speed. The man masquerading as the Flash is a criminal scientist from Alkomar, Korakar Lok. Using a device, called a Celeri-Nuller, Lok transferred the super-speed powers of Alkomar's entire populace into himself. The process, though, proved too much for Lok's muscles. Traveling to Earth, Lok took on the Flash's mantle to lure the real Flash to him. Lok intended to steal the Flash's super-speed to provide a stabilizer for the power he drew from the Alkomaran populace.</p><p>By preemptively stealing the Flash's super-speed before he encountered Lok, Kon has thwarted Lok. Kon convinces Allen to come back to Alkomar with her, to destroy Lok's Celeri-Nuller. After Kon has returned his super-speed powers, Allen, as the Flash, storms Lok's stronghold. Lok's sentries are momentarily caught off guard by the Flash, believing him to be Lok. After a pitched combat, the Flash triumphs over Lok's three guards. Using an Alkomar weapon, the Flash destroys the Celeri-Nuller, returning the stolen super-speed powers to the planet's populace. The Flash returns to Earth, with Kon, and learns from West, that Lok has cut a path of destruction across the Earth.</p><p>Lok is desperate to draw out the Flash, so that he can steal his super-speed, with the portable celeri-nuller, hidden behind his chest insignia. The Flash races to California, to confront Lok. Vibrating his molecules into an intangible state, the Flash hides inside a tree, then strikes as Lok passes. With his first strike, the Flash destroys Lok's portable celeri-nuller. Though Lok still possess greater speed, the Flash's greater experience allows him to outmaneuver and, eventually, overcome Lok. Kon draws out the rest of Lok's super-speed, and returns him to Alkomar. The Flash hopes that the next time he encounter Kon will be under happier circumstances.</p><h3><ins>The Day Flash Aged 100 Years!</ins></h3><p>Looking to forcibly retire the Flash in his prime, the Top steals a vial of a rapid aging serum. The next day, the Top steals one of the <a href=""/mirror-master/4005-7652/"" data-ref-id=""4005-7652"">Mirror Master</a>'s looking glass weapons, from an exhibit at the Flash Museum. The Top leaves behind a taunting note, daring the Flash to stop his crime spree. The Top strikes again, at the Flash Museum, but this time the Flash is on hand to stop him. Quickly the Top detonates the top grenade filled with the rapid aging serum. In a matter of seconds, the Flash grows extremely old. After belting the aged Flash into unconsciousness, the Top escapes.</p><p>The Flash, though, actually vibrated his molecules into an intangible state, allowing the rapid aging serum to pass harmlessly through him. With the theatrical help of the Flash Museum's curator, Dexter Myles, the Flash used old age make-up to fake the transformation. Still pretending to be extremely old, the Flash tries, and fails, to stop the Top's next robbery. On their next encounter, though, the Flash turns the tables on the Top. The Flash undergoes a bizarre rapid evolution, seemingly brought on by the spinning vibrations of the Top's weapons.</p><p>With his newly evolved psychic abilities, the Flash thwarts the Top's robbery. Using a holographic Top projector, the Top flees. The Top is just about to expose himself to the rapid aging serum, to then evolve as the Flash has, when the Flash snags the vial from him. After beating down the Top, and carrying him off to jail, the Flash relays the secrets of his ""evolved"" powers to Myles.

As it begins to spin, it emits beams of light, which transforms the citizens into whirling wisps of energy. The faster the machine spins, the farther it's beams of light reach, inciting a panicked exodus from Central City. Enter the Flash. The Scarlet Speedster runs counterclockwise to the machine's rotating arms, creating a whirlwind that begins to slow it down. The machine stops, briefly, but resumes spinning before the Flash can act. The Flash uses the same maneuver to halt the device, then, still moving at super-human speed, batters it to pieces with his bare hands. Unfortunately, the device's destruction does not restore the afflicted populace to normal. The Flash receives word that another mysterious device has landed in Hokkaido.</p><p>This device emits a powerful sucking force that is drawing civilians into it's maw. The Flash generates a powerful opposing wind force, that tears the motor out of the device. It's victims, though, are not recovered. The Flash receives word that yet another mysterious device has landed in Madrid. En route to Madrid, the Flash comes under laser fire, from an alien craft. The Flash fakes taking a direct hit, then vibrates, invisibly, aboard the ship. Taking the pilot by surprise, the Flash literally punches his head off. Horrified at the accidental decapitation of his foe, the Flash freezes just long enough for the headless alien to blast him into unconsciousness. The Flash awakens in an energy pyramid. His captor identifies himself as Zedubon Zarr, an alien gunrunner.</p><p>Having recently pilfered an armory on Xorcer, Zarr discovered that, as a security measure against theft, the weapons were programmed to automatically activate, after a measured lapse of time. Endanger of becoming a victim to the very weapons he had stolen, Zarr jettisoned them over Earth. By the time Zarr had determined a way to get around the Xorcer anti-theft protocols, the Flash had already destroyed two of the weapons. Zarr, though, sees the Flash as a way of recouping his lost profits, by selling the Flash, himself, as a weapon. While Zarr busies himself collecting the Xorcer weapons strewn about Earth, the Flash resumes his civilian identity, that of police forensics scientist, Barry Allen.</p><p>Once Zarr discovers Allen within the energy pyramid, Allen convinces Zarr that the Flash teleported out, by changing places with Allen. Zarr releases Allen on the condition that Allen leads him to the Flash. Moving faster than the eye can see, Allen dons his Flash uniform, as soon as Zarr shuts down the pyramid. The Flash attacks Zarr, but finds that he cannot land a single blow. Zarr possesses the uncanny ability to detach any of his body parts from one another, while still maintaining complete control over them. Soon the Flash finds himself battling against multiple pieces of Zarr, all working in unison against him. The Flash seals Zarr's lower extremities in Zarr's ship, then binds Zarr's arms about his torso.</p><p>The Flash grabs Zarr's disembodied head, only to receive a powerful electric shock, projected through Zarr's hair. Stamping his feet at super-speed, the Flash builds up a cushion of compressed air, lifting him off the ground. No longer grounded, the electric current from Zarr's hair passes harmlessly through the Flash. The Flash squeezes Zarr's hair (in actuality his brain) until Zarr passes out. The Flash knots Zarr's hair together to keep him in an unconscious state. A Xorcer space patrol ship arrives to take Zarr into custody. After restoring the human victims of their weapons, the Xorcer patrolman tells the Flash that one day, Earth, too, will only design non-lethal weapons. When Earth outlaws war, it will take it's rightful place among the civilizations of the universe.</p><h3><ins>The One-Man Justice League!</ins></h3><p>While relaxing at home, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, hears a news bulletin regarding a robbery by the Land-Sea-Air Gang. Allen activates his costume ring, to go into action as the Flash, only to see the Green Lantern's costume emerge from the ring. Quickly ascertaining that he's lost his super-speed powers, Allen just as quickly learns he has a working power ring. Allen corrals one of the gang's helicopters, using the power ring. As Allen closes in on the gang, he suddenly finds himself wearing Hawkman's costume. Allen use the anti-gravity power of Hawkman's Nth metal wings to destroy the gang's getaway car.</p><p>Allen begins brawling with the gang, until he's floored by a lucky punch. As Allen hits the ground, his costume changes again, to that of Aquaman. Unbeknownst to Allen,the evil scientific genius, Professor Ivo, is using the Flash's aura to steal and absorb the powers of the individual members of the <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/"" data-ref-id=""4060-31815"">Justice League of America</a>. Unbeknownst to Ivo, he has not actually succeeded in duplicating the Flash's aura, but is using the Flash's actual aura to effect his power thefts. Thus, Allen is briefly gaining the same powers, as Ivo draws them into himself. Allen pursues the Land-Sea-Air Gang, as Aquaman. Allen commands the marine life to clog up the rotors on the gang's getaway boat with seaweed.</p><p>As Allen boards their vessel, the gang opens up on him. Allen is saved when he suddenly transforms into the Atom. Unfamiliar with using the Atom's size and weight controls, Allen finds the gang getting the better of him. Having failed to take into account <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/superman/4005-1807/"" data-ref-id=""4005-1807"">Superman</a>'s invulnerability, Ivo overloads his power theft machines, until they explode. With the destruction of the device, Allen, once more, becomes the Flash. In short order, the Flash takes down the Land-Sea-Air Gang. Ivo lies in the rubble of his laboratory, his fate unknown.</p>",,,,,,,False,8342,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4609150-158.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",158,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55746/', 'id': 55746, 'name': 'Japan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/japan/4020-55746/'}]",Battle Against The Breakaway Bandit!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57276/', 'id': 57276, 'name': 'Nth Metal Wings', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nth-metal-wings/4055-57276/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': ''}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-158-battle-against-the-breakaway-bandit/4000-8342/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Luckily, Kid Flash rushes in.</em></p><h3><ins>The Flash's Final Fling!</ins></h3><p>On Earth-2, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, and Kid Flash pay a visit to Doctor Charles McNider. Feeling that Central City no longer gives him the accolades and appreciation he deserves, Allen has foresworn his career as the Flash. As Allen was preparing to leave Central City forever, Kid Flash abducted him, and brought Allen to Earth-2. Under hypnosis, Allen reveals that chronal officer Petar Thrant, from the year 3780, came to him, and mesmerized him into retiring his Flash identity. It seems a criminal from Thrant's time, Frand Mattar, had planted an explosive device in Central City.</p><p>Fearing the Flash's super-speed vibrations might trigger the bomb,Thrant came back in time to ""convince"" Allen not to use his powers anymore. McNider's offer to assist the Scarlet Speedsters, in his guise as Doctor Mid-Nite, is rebuffed. Allen wants to handle this case personally, with only Kid Flash at his side. As the two speedsters cross the dimensional gulf, between Earth-1 and Earth-2, they accelerate to the point that they break the time barrier, arriving on Earth-1 in the year 3780. Despite Thrant's warnings, the Scarlet Speedsters immediately head off to confront Mattar. They discover Mattar in the process of stealing an entire bank. Mattar activates the detonator for the bomb.</p><p>The Scarlet Speedsters have only three minutes to defeat Mattar, and his gang, then return to their time, to deal with the bomb. Despite the deadline, the Flash purposely takes more then two minutes to beat down Mattar, and his gang, to teach them a lesson. Returning to present day Central City, the Scarlet Speedsters match their internal vibratory frequency to that of Mattar's detonator signal. Following the signal to the bomb's location, they arrive just as it begins to explode. Racing around the blast site at super-human speed, the Scarlet Speedsters are able to contain the force of the explosion within a powerful whilrlwind. The Flash's latest adventure makes all the headlines, and the Flash, himself, is presented with the key to the city.</p><h3><ins>Big Blast In Rocket City!</ins></h3><p>Police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, and his girlfriend, Picture News reporter, Iris West, have joined her father, on vacation, in Florida. Professor West lingers at the restaurant, insisting that his daughter, and Allen, head off to have some fun. West is waiting for his colleagues in the Space Agency, to unveil his latest inventions. Overhearing Allen call West ""Professor"", three thugs in an adjoining booth, mistakenly believe West to be a criminal genius, known only as ""The Brain"". The three thugs introduce themselves to West, who, in his absent-mindedness, believes them to be his colleagues. West accompanies them to their hideout, then provides them with his first invention, a formula for overcoming vertigo in space.</p><p>The crooks instead use the formula to<em> cause</em> vertigo in the security guards, when they rob the richest department store in Rocket City. West grows concerned over her father's long absence. Overhearing a news report on the robbery, Allen prepares to swing into action, as the Flash. West, though, insists that Allen help her look for her father. West excuses herself to the powder room to get ready. Allen determines that he has exactly 10 minutes to capture the crooks, before West returns. Allen, as the Flash, runs down the crooks who, nonetheless, escape him when they activate the rocket engine in their car. Another contribution from Professor West, being repurposed for criminal use. The Flash tracks the car by following the luminous molecules of the rocket fuel left in it's wake.</p><p>The Flash discovers that the crooks are holding the professor. Using another of the professor inventions, a force field designed to aid with re-entry, the crooks are able to keep the Flash at bay. The Flash tunnels under the force field, and burrows up into the house. West stops one of the gunmen from shooting the Flash. After defeating the three criminals, the Flash races back to his hotel room. As West emerges from the powder room, Allen informs her that they won't have to search for her father afterall.

Allen pursues the turtle, as the Flash. Astonishingly, the turtle outpaces the Flash. Pouring on the speed, the Flash feels himself tearing through inter-dimensional space. The Flash materializes on a strange world. One where all of it's inhabitants possess super-human speed. Returning to Earth, the Flash discovers that, while he was only on the alien world for two minutes, five hours have elapsed on Earth. His bride-to-be, Picture News reporter, Iris West, is furious that Allen has stood her up at the altar. West breaks up with Allen, vowing to never see him again. Allen's crushing heartbreak leaves him feeling lonely and despondent.</p><p>Allen blames his alter-ego, the Flash, for ruining his relationship with West. Allen nails his Flash costume to a tree, and leaves a sign declaring his intention to retire his Flash identity. As Allen walks away, tears seem to stream down the eye-holes of the costume's mask. Allen tracks down West, at an isolated mountain retreat. Seeing West menaced by a large bear, Allen intervenes. Refusing to use his super-speed, Allen is viciously beaten down by the bear. The bear turns out to be a retired, runaway circus performer, and thus Allen is not unduly injured. West is not happy to see Allen. Having transferred her affections to the Flash, Allen finds that he is his own rival. Allen's Flash costume is discovered, then placed on display at the Flash Museum.</p><p>Near closing time, Allen stands alone before his Flash costume. Incredibly, he seems to hear the costume speaking to him, begging him to resume his career as the Flash. Allen even believes he sees tears pouring from the eye-holes of the mask. Giving in to the inevitable, Allen dons his Flash costume once more. Suddenly, Allen realizes that he isn't alone, and turns to see West standing behind him. To make matters worse, a gang of thugs enters and takes West hostage. The Flash easily beats down the would-be thieves, planting a kiss on West's lips as he does so. West stands transfixed, believing herself hypnotized into thinking that Allen really was the Flash. Dismissing the evidence of her own eyes, West resumes her romance with Allen, still not knowing that he is, in fact, the Flash.</p><h3><ins>The Mirror with 20-20 Vision!</ins></h3><p>By accident, the Mirror Master creates a mirror that reflects 20 seconds into the future. Testing the reflection, the Mirror Master finds that no action can change the future reflected in the mirror. The Mirror Master steals Cleopatra's Mirror from the Petty Art Gallery. When the Flash inevitably arrives to capture the Mirror Master, he finds himself holding the fading remnants of a reflection. A second encounter goes no better. Once again the Mirror Master successfully completes a crime, and escapes, leaving behind another mirror image for the Flash.</p><p>Using his Cosmic Treadmill, the Flash races three days into the future. Discovering the Mirror Master's hideout, the Flash attacks the his old foe. The Mirror Master, though, has already seen the Flash coming, in his future reflecting mirror. The Mirror Master gets the drop on the Flash, and seemingly vaporizes him. The Mirror Master has barely any time to gloat over his victory, when he hears the Flash's voice behind him. The Scarlet Speedster quickly destroys the future reflecting mirror, then beats the living daylights out of the Mirror Master.</p><p>In an interview with Picture News reporter, Iris West, the Flash reveals how he triumphed over the Mirror Master. As the Mirror Master fired upon him, the Flash ceased the internal vibrations keeping him three days in the future, and immediately returned to the present. The Flash then waited the three days, to secretly return to the Mirror Master's lair. After watching himself seemingly be killed by the Mirror Master, the Flash stepped in and defeated his old foe. Back at the Petty Art Gallery, the Flash, as Allen, tells West that he can see a future image of himself, in Cleopatra's Mirror, kissing West. Before West can protest, Allen fulfills his future.</p>",,,,,,,False,8519,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7717-1995-8519-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",161,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",The case Of the Curious Costume / The Mirror with 20-20 Vision!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58436/', 'id': 58436, 'name': 'Mirror Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-gun/4055-58436/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43530/', 'id': 43530, 'name': 'Robert Kanigher', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/robert-kanigher/4040-43530/', 'role': 'writer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-161-the-case-of-the-curious-costume-the-/4000-8519/,1966-03-03,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Approaching the exit to the Tunnel Of Terrors, Dempsey is transformed into an ""Ornitho-Man"", an extinct creature that inhabited the Earth millions of years ago. Dempsey goes on a rampage, and begins to destroy his own theme park. The Flash responds to the trouble. The Flash engages Dempsey in pitched combat. Ultimately, in the Penny Arcade, the Flash triumphs over Dempsey. The blinding lights of a giant score board transform Dempsey back into a human being.</p><p>The Flash is all set to investigate the Tunnel Of Terrors when he is suddenly gripped by an all-consuming fear. Despite the insistence of the park's security personnel, the Flash refuses to enter the attraction. Undeterred by the Flash's sudden streak of cowardice, Picture News reporter, Iris West, enters the Tunnel Of Terrors. West begins snapping a series of photographs, documenting the attraction's interior. Unbeknownst to West, one of the attraction's monstrous plastic figures begins stalking her. Shaking off the grip of fear, the Flash enters the Tunnel of Terrors.</p><p>The Flash rescues West before she can be attacked. More of the attraction's plastic creature replicas come to life. The Flash carries West out of the attraction, then heads back in to confront the animated horrors. Believing that the flash of West's camera broke the spell of fear that had hold of him, the Flash uses West's camera on the animated creatures. The flash has no effect, however, and soon the Scarlet Speedster finds himself overwhelmed by the unliving monstrous figures. In a desperate, pitched battle, the Flash finally triumphs over his attackers.</p><p>Continuing to fire the flash of West's camera, the Flash encounters the culprit behind the shenanigans in the Tunnel of Terrors. Vardarr Varr, a scientist from the planet Koomool, had, millennia ago, established contact with the Ornitho-Men of Earth. Journeying to Earth to share their civilization's wisdom, Varr's ship was caught in a nuclear explosion. Varr's ship crashes on Earth, and was then encased in molten rock, as it solidified around the ship. There it lay for millennia, until the day Dempsey excavated the crash site. Varr's ship appeared as a strange gem, embedded in the rocks, that gave off an eerie glow.</p><p>Dempsey decided to build the Tunnel of Terrors around the gem, taking advantage of it's unworldly aura. Believing that it was the human race that waged nuclear war upon the Ornitho-Men, wiping them out, and destroying their civilization, Varr vowed revenge. The Flash uses his Cosmic Treadmill to travels millions of years into the past to learn the truth. Using West's camera, the Flash records the destruction of the Ornitho-Men's society, at their own hands.

The Flash retrieves Alice's doll, earning her undying gratitude. A research scientist, Ben Hadden, bathes his cat in a strange radiation. When the housekeeper, Mrs. Prentiss, arrives, with a saucer of milk for the cat, she becomes confused. Prentiss no longer has any recollection of Hadden's cat, or, in fact, that he ever had one. Arriving at police headquarters, the Flash is baffled at the desk sergeant's complete lack of recognition of him. On the street, parolee David Gulch walks right past the Flash, despite an earlier threat to get even with him. It is at this moment that the Flash notices that he is becoming transparent. The Flash races to the newspaper office of Picture News reporter, Iris West.</p><p>Astonishingly, West, too has no memory of ever encountering the Flash. Overhearing a police officer responding to a robbery, the Flash sets aside his problem, to thwart the crime. It takes every last vestige of the Flash's will power to maintain his corporeality. By the time he reaches the scene of the crime, the Flash's body is all but vapor. Anticipating the Flash's intervention, Haddon, the thief, literally blows the Flash's body back to his secret lair. Haddon reveals that he spread a specific type of radiation across Central City, causing the populace to forget the Flash ever existed. Inexplicably, this loss of belief in the Flash is causing the Flash to fade from reality. Haddon exposes himself to the radiation, to sever the Flash's sole remaining tie to reality.</p><p>The Flash, though, doesn't completely fade away, as Haddon expected. Alice's great belief in the Flash is just strong enough to tether the Scarlet Speedster to the material world. The Flash seeks out Alice, finding her at the waterfront. The nearer the Flash approaches to Alice, the more corporeal he becomes. As he moves away from her, however, he begins to fade again. With Alice by his side, the Flash writes a letter to every single person in Central City, begging them to believe in him. The populace complies, restoring the Flash to normal. The Flash travels to the island nation of Bora Balu to bring Haddon to justice. Alice's steadfast belief in the Flash garners her fame and fortune, ensuring her a prosperous future.</p><h3><ins>The Day Magic Exposed Flash's Secret Identity!</ins></h3><p>The Flash is summoned to Central City Penitentiary. Upon arrival, the Flash is asked to speak with his arch-nemesis, Abra Kadabra. Though the man in Abra Kadabra's cell looks and sounds exactly like Abra Kadabra, he is really Slor Disi. A police officer from the 64th century, Disi was telepathically summoned by Abra Kadabra. Believing that Abra Kadabra wished to return to his own century, Disi was sent back to collect Abra Kadabra. Disi was immediately knocked unconscious.</p><p>Abra Kadabra used Disi's future technology to exchange their appearances, then escape. The Flash leaves Disi in Abra Kadabra's cell, until he can investigate Disi's claims. The Flash decides to look for Abra Kadabra at an International Magician's Convention. Sure enough, Abra Kadabra, still appearing as Disi, is there, already on the stage. As the Flash closes in on Abra Kadabra, his uniform is suddenly torn from his body. The Flash accelerates his vibratory rate to blur his features, protecting his secret identity.</p><p>Abra Kadabra counters by using a numbing force to slow the Flash down. Acting quickly, the Flash disguises himself in the garb of the famous stage magicians, displayed in the theater. Moving in and out of one disguise after the next, the Flash confuses Abra Kadabra into firing on the wrong uniform. Once the Flash delivers the knockout blow, Abra Kadabra is turned over to Disi. The 64th century lawman vows that Abra Kadabra will never trouble the Flash, or his century, ever again.</p>",,,,,,,False,8706,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7885-1995-8706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",163,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Flash Stakes His Life--On --You!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-163-the-flash-stakes-his-life-on-you/4000-8706/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Of late, the Scarlet Speedster has found himself with no control over his actions. With no warning, he begins tearing through the streets, at super-human speed, injuring civilians, and incurring massive amounts of property damage. At first, the populace of Central City is more forgiving of the Flash's rampages. After the Scarlet Speedster destroys the bridge over the Central River, though, the Central City citizens have had enough. As police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, the Flash tries to remain in his home. Ultimately, though, he, once again, finds himself compelled to run amok in Central City.</p><p>On this occasion, the Flash accidentally knocks himself out, by running headlong into a brick wall. With the crowd calling for his blood, the Flash is put under arrest by the Central City Police Department. The architect of the Flash's current woes is revealed to be the Pied Piper. Using a special pipe keyed to super-speed vibrations, the Pied Piper has been controlling the Flash's actions. With his foe behind bars, the Pied Piper strikes a deal with Central City's criminal element. The Pied Piper will clear the entire populace from Central City, for three hours, allowing the crooks to loot the entire city, unopposed. In return, the Pied Piper demands half of everything they steal.</p><p>True to his word, the Pied Piper empties Central City. When the time comes to pay the piper, the crooks renege on the deal, offering the Pied Piper only a quarter of their ill-gotten gains. In retaliation for double-crossing him, the Pied PIper forces the Flash to escape from jail, then releases his hold over him. Seeing Central City overrun with criminals, the Flash quickly rounds them all up, and throws them in jail. The Pied Piper reveals himself to the Flash. Before the Pied Piper can regain control of the Flash, the Scarlet Speedster takes his musical nemesis down. Exonerated in the eyes of the public, the Flash receives a special commendation from the mayor's office.</p><h3>The Boy Who Lost Touch With The World!</h3><p>Wally West and Tommy Davis are on a botany field trip. Davis spies some ginseng root growing in the wild. Looking on in horror, West sees a boulder toppling over onto Davis. West, as Kid Flash, races to intercept the boulder, but arrives too late. Surprisingly, the boulder passes harmlessly through Davis. Kid Flash quickly realizes that it is only because of his ultra-fast vision that he can even perceive Davis. In fact, Kid Flash must vibrate at super-human speed to hear Davis' words. Davis reveals that he was the unfortunate victim of a laboratory accident, involving an experiment in invisibility.</p><p>The effects of the accident on Davis were not immediately apparent. Kid Flash takes Davis to Davis' father's research enterprises laboratory. There they encounter a group of thieves, ransacking the premises. Kid Flash makes short work of the two crooks. A third man, though, hiding in the shadows, observes Davis' power of invisibility. Vibrating at super-speed, in close proximity to Davis, Kid Flash is able to slough off the vibratory energy keeping Davis out of sync with the world. When Davis is finally able to hold a glass of water, and drink it, Kid Flash stops.</p><p>Davis, alone at home, realizes that Kid Flash must be West. Davis phones West, only to be interrupted by the third crook. Looking to capitalize on Davis' power of invisibility, the crook has tracked the boy to his home. Kid Flash arrives and beats the living daylights out of the crook. When Davis returns to the phone receiver, he finds West still on the line. Completely underestimating just how fast Kid Flash can move, Davis determines that West couldn't possibly be Kid Flash, since he can't be in two places at the same time. West is secure in the knowledge that his secret identity remains a secret.</p>",,,,,,,False,8769,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7939-1995-8769-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",164,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Flash--Vandal Of Central City!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-164-flash-vandal-of-central-city/4000-8769/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

On hand to celebrate the momentous occasion are the bride's father, Professor West, Wally West, and his parents, the curator of the <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/flash-museum/4020-50067/"" data-ref-id=""4020-50067"">Flash Museum</a>, Dexter Myles, actress Daphne Dean, Al and Rita Desmond, and the groom's parents, Doctor and Mrs. Allen.</p><p>West is escorted down the aisle, to stand beside her would-be husband, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. Just before the minister can complete the ceremony, the Flash barges in and accuses Allen of being an imposter. Flashback, and forward, to the 25th Century, where the Flash's nemesis, Professor Zoom stands incarcerated. The Reverse Flash telepathically switches minds, and body, with Allen, taking his place in the 20th Century. Using a matter distributer, Professor Zoom alters his face to look like Allen's. Intending to take the Flash's place, in every possible way, Professor Zoom, as the Flash, responds to a police bulletin about a robbery.</p><p>Professor Zoom uses the matter distributer to subdue the would-be jewel thieves. However, when Professor Zoom moves to return the stolen diamonds, he finds he just <em>can't</em> do it. Instead, Professor Zoom keeps the diamonds himself. Racing around the city as the Flash, Professor Zoom revels in the newfound respect and admiration he receives from Central City's populace. Meanwhile, Allen finds himself trapped in Professor Zoom's cell, in the 25th Century. Realizing his super-speed abilities will avail him naught in escaping, Allen, instead, uses the powerful suction of his Flash costume ring, to weaken the radioactive walls of this cell.</p><p>The Flash is finally able to pull himself out of the cell, overpower the guards, and return to the 20th Century, just in time to stop the wedding. The Flash grabs ""Allen"", and whisks him out of the chapel, to the astonished eyes of the wedding party. Donning his Reverse Flash costume, Professor Zoom agrees to fight the Flash for the honor of marrying West. The two super-speedsters engage in an epic battle, that spans all of Central City. Having not completely mastered all of the Flash's super-speed tricks, Professor Zoom fails to run across the surface of a nearby lake, allowing the Flash to gain the advantage over him.</p><p>With Professor Zoom unconscious, authorities from the 25th Century take possession of the Reverse Flash, promising to do a better job of keeping him incarcerated. The Flash, as Allen, returns to the chapel, and marries West. With Wally West, as Kid Flash, keeping a watchful eye over Central City, the happy couple depart on their honeymoon. Allen continues to wrestle with the question of whether or not to reveal his secret identity to West.</p>",,,,,,,False,8914,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/8071-1995-8914-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",165,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",One Bridegroom Too Many!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'penciler, inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-165-one-bridegroom-too-many/4000-8914/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Walking home, Allen feels a slight vibration in his hand, and accidentally releases his Flash costume, from it's housing, within in his ring. Allen determines that the vibratory effect is coming from a nearby building, and investigates, as the Flash. There, a five man crew of thieves is working their way inside a vault. Each of these men are looking at a lifetime in prison, should they ever be arrested again. The arrival of the Flash fills them with dread and desperation. The Flash is seconds away from taking down the whole gang, when he suddenly bolts from the room. The Flash races to the offices of Picture News where, as Allen, he approaches his wife, reporter Iris West, intent on revealing his secret identity to her.</p><p>West puts Allen off, lest she blow her deadline. The overwhelming compulsion to expose his identity to West passes. Allen, as the Flash, resumes his pursuit of the criminal gang. Running down their getaway car, the Flash is, once again seconds aways from defeating them, when he, again, bolts away. The Flash, as Allen, returns to the offices of Picture News, intent on revealing his secret identity to West. Again, West rebuffs him to finish writing her article. When the compulsion fades again, Allen realizes that he is suffering from the delayed reaction, of an experimental truth serum, he had been working on in his laboratory. Each time the cigar-smoking criminal, ""Chompers"", blew smoke in the Flash's face, it triggered a chemical reaction activating the dormant truth serum in Allen's system.</p><p>Downing an antidote, the Flash tracks the criminals down, by following the trail of exhaust molecules left by their getaway car. The five criminals have also guessed that Chompers' cigar smoke was somehow causing the Flash to flee from them. When the Flash arrives to arrest them, Chompers, ""Profile"", and ""The Mole"", are all smoking cigars. Despite their breathing smoke on him, the Flash mops up the floor with the five criminals. Only their strongman, the former wrestler ""Ek Ek"", gives the Flash even a moment's trouble. At home, the Flash, as Allen doses West with the truth serum, and confirms that the serum is a failure. It only affected Allen due to his unique body chemistry, brought about by his super-human speed powers.</p><h3>Tempting Target For The Temperature Twins!</h3><p>Police Forensics scientist, Barry Allen, discovers the Real Cool Refrigeration Company is on fire. Allen, as the Flash, races inside to rescue any trapped workers. Grabbing up two people, the Flash is racing out of the building, when the floor collapse. The added weight of the two workers throws the Flash off-balance, causing him to sprain his ankle upon landing. After receiving medical attention, the Flash is photographed leaving the scene, clearly injured, potentially jeopardizing his secret identity.</p><p>Across town, Captain Cold and Heat Wave have teamed up on a crime spree. Looting a jewelry store, the hot and cold felons encounter Miss Fashion Gem Of Central City. Both men declare their love for her. Out of jealously, the two super-criminals are about to come to blows, when they decide on a contest to decide who gets the girl. Their contest, of course, is to see which of them can put the Flash permanently out of action. Encountering their foe on the street, as he hobbles by on crutches, Captian Cold and Heat Wave open up on the Flash, with their signature weapons.</p><p>Unable to dodge, the Flash quickly discovers that the two temperature extremes, combined, are rapidly speeding up the healing process on his ankle. With his ankle fully restored, the Flash maneuvers around his opponents, at super-human speed, causing them to blast each other into unconsciousness. After dropping the two crooks off at the nearest police station, the Flash, as Allen, meets up with his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, to celebrate their one month anniversary.</p><p> </p><h3> </h3>",,,,,,,False,8982,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/2764797-flash166vf85m123.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",166,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",The Last Stand Of The Three-Time Losers!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58440/', 'id': 58440, 'name': ""Heat Wave's Flamethrower"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heat-waves-flamethrower/4055-58440/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-166-the-last-stand-of-the-three-time-los/4000-8982/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

And it’s not at all what you are expecting.</em></p><h3>The Real Origin of the Flash!</h3><p>The Flash is seconds away from bringing down a ring of smugglers, when his protective aura vanishes, causing him to burst into flames. The Flash dives into the river to douse himself. Upon surfacing, he is confronted by Mopee, Initiate Tenth Class Of The Heavenly Help-Mates. Mopee reveals that the laboratory accident that gave the Flash his super-speed powers was, in fact, no accident. In reality, it was Mopee who was charged, by his superiors, to bestow upon him the gift of super-speed. Some years passed before Mopee came back to his home dimension, having gotten lost on the return journey. Upon arrival, Mopee learned that he failed to follow the rules and regulations for bestowing power on others, and thus, is obliged to remove the Flash's powers. For several moments, the Flash favorably considers a life without his powers.</p><p>Ultimately, though, the Flash realizes that he has a responsibility to uphold, and asks to make a deal. Reviewing the rules of his people, Mopee finds that, having made a mistake the first time, he is allowed to try again, provided all the pertinent criteria is met. In this case, the Flash must purchase the laboratory chemicals used in his transformation, to be eligible to receive Mopee's gift. The Flash has only 24 hours to earn the money to buy the chemicals. He must also earn that money <em>as the Flash</em>. Mopee temporarily returns the Flash's super-speed powers to him, so that he may proceed with winning them back permanently. Placing an advertisement in the local paper, seeking employment, the Flash receives a multitude of job offers. The Flash opts for a delivery position at a local plastics factory.</p><p>Despite the tremendous amount of work required of him, the Flash is only willing to work for the exact amount of money he needs, and not a penny more. Delivering the last of the packages, the Flash's protective aura cuts out on him again, once more setting him ablaze. After dousing the flames, the Flash notices that the package, which also caught fire, holds the very diamonds the ring of smugglers had stolen. After Mopee has, once again, restored his super-speed, the Flash races to the delivery address on the package. Sure enough, he finds the ring of smugglers. After the Flash has taken down the entire ring, Mopee recreates the accident that bestowed upon the Flash his super-human speed. The gift of super-human speed successfully... and properly... given, Mopee returns to his home dimension.</p><h3>The Hypnotic Super-Speedster</h3><p>Doctor Erik Darren, master hypnotist, performs before an assemblage of students, at Blue Valley High School. Darren takes the student's requests, demonstrating his amazing power of suggestion. When the students ask Darren to make the overweight Chubby Jones run around the world, as fast as Kid Flash, Darren balks. Darren cannot hypnotize someone into possessing super-powers. However, Darren relents to the students' pressure, and hypnotizes Jones.</p><p>Suddenly, to the astonishment of all involved, Jones takes off like a streak of lightning. Unbeknownst to Darren, and the audience, Kid Flash, himself, has decided to intervene, and invisibly carries Jones around the world. On his return trip to the auditorium, Kid Flash spies the school's custodian, being assaulted by a group of thugs. Returning Jones to the stage, Kid Flash, still unseen, races back to rescue the custodian. Kid Flash has all but beaten down the gang of crooks, when he misjudges the speed of a descending crowbar, and takes a grazing blow to the temple.</p><p>Upon recovering, Kid Flash learns, from the custodian, that the thugs stole the necessary tools to perform a ""loft job"". Kid Flash runs down the all the likely locations the thieves could be targeting. Kid Flash finds them looting a fur warehouse.

The Green Lantern is missing. Allen is asked to investigate his disappearance, as the Flash. Meanwhile, the brilliant Hjalmer Helms, a scientist obsessed with traveling in time, fails, again to create a time machine. Unbeknownst to Helms, he has fallen on the radar of two lowlifes, Ace and Stubble. After rendering Helms unconscious and locking him away, the two men take possession of Helms' astonishing inventions.</p><p>Armed with a Paralysis Pistol, and a Sleep Gun, the two men begin a crime spree across Central City. Outfitting themselves in garish ""futuristic"" costumes, Ace and Stubble, along with their friends, Doubler and the Fixer, begin their careers as super-criminals. On their first outing to rob a bank, the gang runs afoul of the Flash. Despite their super-weapons, the gang is all but defeated by the Flash, in a matter of seconds. Only a lucky, stray shot from the Sleep Gun, allows them to triumph over the Flash, and flee the scene. Back at home, the Flash, as Allen enjoys brunch with his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West.</p><p>Allen turns on the television, in the hopes of hearing some news about the criminal gang. West spies Hal Jordan, on a fishing boat, in the background of an interview with Stelo Pantagolis, a local fisherman. Unbeknownst to West, Jordan is the Green Lantern. Allen, as the Flash, races down to the docks to meet up with Jordan. There, the Flash discovers that Jordan is suffering from amnesia. Backtracking to Jordan's hotel, the Flash vibrates at super-human speed, until he matches the wavelength of Jordan's invisible power battery.</p><p>Guiding Jordan's ring hand into the power battery, the Flash has Jordan repeat after him, the oath of the Green Lantern Corps. At once, Jordan's memories return to him. Jordan had been in the midst of recharging his ring, when a backfire of extraordinary energy overwhelmed him. When Jordan awoke he had no memory of who, or where he was. He wandered the streets of Central City, until Pantagolis discovered him, and took him on as a deckhand. A police bulletin is caught on the Flash's wrist-radio. Ace's gang is attacking the Central City Speedway.The Flash and The Green Lantern team-up to take down Ace's gang.In short order, Ace's gang is beat down until only Stubble remains standing.</p><p>Seeing the futility of continuing the fight, Stubble turns his Sleep Gun on himself. After turning the crooks over to the police, the two heroes, through interrogation, learn of Helms' fate. After freeing Helms, the Green Lantern learns that it was one of Helms' time travel experiments that tapped into the energy of the power battery, causing the violent expulsion of power that erased his memory. The Green Lantern, as Jordan, invites Allen and West out, for a fishing expedition, on Pantagolis' boat. Unbeknownst to the group, they are watched over by a very pleased Guardian of Oa, happy that the Green Lantern has been found.</p>",,,,,,,False,9185,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4107382-flash168nm9m085.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",168,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-57056/', 'id': 57056, 'name': 'Laboratory', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/laboratory/4020-57056/'}]",One of Our Green Lanterns is Missing!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-38240/', 'id': 38240, 'name': 'Sid Greene', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sid-greene/4040-38240/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-168-one-of-our-green-lanterns-is-missing/4000-9185/,1967-01-19,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-9057/', 'id': 9057, 'name': 'Guardians of the Universe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Afterwards, West rekindles her friendship with Margot Tyler, one of the performers in the play. Allen is introduced to John Cardine, the actor who played Merlin. Allen hears a loud voice, which reveals his secret identity as the Flash. As no one else reacts to the revelation, Allen realizes that he, alone, heard the words, as if by magic. Allen immediately suspects Cardine. West and Tyler head out to get caught up on one another's lives. Allen, as the Flash, invisibly follows Cardine to Ceramics Castle. Upon entry, the Flash loses Cardine, but discovers a gang of thieves robbing Ceramics Castle. The Flash quickly takes down the entire gang, and escorts them to the nearest police precinct.</p><p>Outside the station house, the owner of Ceramics Castle hands the Flash a curious medallion as a reward. The Flash momentarily glances at the medallion, then turns to hand it back. The Ceramics Castle owner, however, has vanished. Once inside the police precinct, the Flash is at a loss as to why he brought the group of thieves in. Apologizing for his mistake, the Flash departs. Unbeknownst to the Flash, his actions are under observation by three mysterious strangers. En route home, the Flash fails to notice a mugging, an armored car robbery, a mob war, and a jewelry store robbery. The three mysterious strangers are deeply troubled by the Flash's lack of action. Unbeknownst to all parties, the Flash is also being watched by the owner of Ceramics Castle. The owner's features blur into those of Cardine, before finally revealing that he is really Abra Kadabra.</p><p>The 64th Century native had been stewing in a prison cell. His only companion, an escape-proof robot, that monitored his every action. Abra Kadabra was able to trick the robot into providing the necessary material to build a ""Psychonizer"". The device suppresses those areas of the brain that allows it's victims to see, hear, or speak of evil. Using the ""Psychonizer"" to incapacitate the robot, Abra Kadabra escaped from prison and traveled back in time, to the 20th Century. As Cardine, Abra Kadabra revealed his knowledge of the Flash's secret identity, ensuring that the Flash would follow him to Ceramics Castle. As the owner of Ceramics Castle, Abra Kadabra placed the ""Psychonizer"" in the Flash's hand, removing the Flash's ability to see, hear or speak of evil.</p><p>Upon returning home, the Flash, as Allen, is stunned to see the Golden Age Flash, Doctor Fate, and Doctor Mid-Nite waiting for him, in his living room. Allen is informed about all the crimes he walked right past, without lifting a finger to stop. In his Tower, Doctor Fate became aware of a sinister force, originating in the future, that settled in Central City. Rendezvousing with the Golden Age Flash and Doctor Mid-Nite, the three Justice Society of America members traveled to Earth-1 to warn the Flash. Doctor Fate is unable to remove Abra Kadabra's ""spell"" from Allen. Doctor Fate reveals Abra Kadabra's next criminal enterprise. The Flash teams up with the Justice Society of America members to bring down Abra Kadabra. Though the Flash cannot perceive the criminals robbing the museum, the Justice Society of America, acting invisibly, aid him in the take down.</p><p>Doctor Mid-Nite detonates one of his patented blackout bombs, plunging the room into darkness. The Golden Age Flash steers his counterpart into the criminals. Doctor Fate animates the statues into combatants. With the Justice Society of Amercia's presence invisible to the naked eye, Abra Kadabra erroneously believes that the""Psychonizer"" has, somehow, given the Flash an array of new powers. Abra Kadabra immobilizes the Flash by conjuring clutching hands, up from the wooden floor. Doctor Fate commandeers the hands, and has them swing the Flash at, and into, Abra Kadabra. Abra Kadabra levitates the Flash, and sets him to spinning like a top. Doctor Fate is unable to counter Abra Kadabra's magic, as it is actually super-science. Doctor Mid-Nite uses a device, called a ""Cryotuber"", to cushion the Flash's impact with the far wall.</p><p>Doctor Fate divides the Flash into multiple Flashs, surrounding Abra Kadabra. In desperartion, Abra Kadabra removes the effects of the ""Psychonizer"" on the Flash, in the hopes of erasing all of his new powers. Able to finally see Abra Kadabra, the Flash bombards him with the bodies of the fallen thieves. Abra Kadabra causes the Flash's uniform to constrict about him. The Flash vibrates out of his uniform, and beats Abra Kadabra unconscious. The Flash uses his Cosmic Treadmill to return Abra Kadabra to the 64th century. The Justice Society of America return to Earth-2. West, finally returning home from her night out with Tyler, spies Allen returning home late as well. Allen says he ran into some old friends, too, who were only in town for a short time. When West asks to meet them some day, Allen says she will. Provided, of course, that he can work up the courage to tell his wife that he is the Flash.</p>",,,,,,,False,9328,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/8446-1995-9328-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",170,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55851/', 'id': 55851, 'name': 'Tower of Fate', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tower-of-fate/4020-55851/'}]",The See-Nothing Spells Of Abra Kadabra!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-47350/', 'id': 47350, 'name': 'Blackout bomb', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blackout-bomb/4055-47350/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56063/', 'id': 56063, 'name': 'Helmet of Fate', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/helmet-of-fate/4055-56063/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-38240/', 'id': 38240, 'name': 'Sid Greene', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sid-greene/4040-38240/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-170-the-see-nothing-spells-of-abra-kadab/4000-9328/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-27589/', 'id': 27589, 'name': 'Justice Society of America', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Particularly heartbreaking to West is the story of Beth, a lost, five year old girl, with little memory of her early life. West's husband, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, has his own problems. A new thief, the Green Ghost, has been looting Central City. While West is driving Allen to work, they see the owner of a jewelry store, crying out that he is being robbed by the Green Ghost. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Racing into the store, the Flash finds no trace of the Green Ghost. The jewelry store owner, Charles Perkins, is relieved to discover that his souvenir chess piece has not been taken.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the Flash, the Green Ghost is standing right next to him, appearing as a small spider. Back at his secret lair, the spider illusion is dropped, revealing the true culprit behind the Green Ghost's crimes, Doctor Light. Having faced separate defeats at the hands of the Justice League of America, the Atom, and the Green Lantern. Doctor Light has decided to try his luck with the Flash. His latest invention, the ""Photonikron"", allows him to cast light illusions around himself, so that he may appear as, literally, anything. At home, Allen is contacted by Dexter Myles, the curator of the Flash Museum. The stolen jewels, from the jewelry store robbery, have appeared at the Flash Museum.</p><p>Allen investigates, as the Flash. Observing the gemstones, Myles and the Flash are struck by twin beams of light. Myles is floored, but the Flash only takes a glancing blow. The gemstones, really an illusion-masked Doctor Light, begin peppering the Flash with spheres of light. The Flash retaliates by hammering away at the gemstones. Once again, Doctor Light is on the verge of losing a fight. A blinding potpourri of kaleidoscopic colors explodes around the Flash, giving Doctor Light the chance to change his surrounding illusion. Appearing as Myles, Doctor Light is able to get in a couple of surprise punches, before the Flash mops up the floor with him.</p><p>Desperately, Doctor Light, still appearing as Myles, levels one of his special light weapons on the Flash, and murders the Scarlet Speedster. Perceiving no heartbeat, Doctor Light casts the illusion of a concrete slab about the Flash, and carefully places him, on the sidewalk, of a busy Central City street. The Flash, upon recovering, gradually comes to the realization that the world perceives him as a concrete section of sidewalk. After being stepped on a few times too many, the Flash finds that he can still stand up, and does. As he moves down the street, bystanders become terrified at the sight of a mobile block of concrete.</p><p>The police take the block into custody, where police scientists attempt to break a piece off the block for analysis. The Flash suffers a pounding chisel blow to his head, being doused in cold water, and scraped on the nose. Finally, the police forensic scientist, desperate to break off a sample of the ""concrete block"", begins violently kicking the Flash. Having observed the ""concrete block"" moving down the street, Doctor Light arrives at police headquarters, to finish off the Flash. Vibrating at super-human speed had saved the Flash's life back at the Flash Museum. Now, as those vibrations finally begin to slow, the light illusion fades from around him.</p><p>The Flash vibrates into intangibility to avoid Doctor Light's laser attack. Doctor Light counters by switching to a vibratory weapon, attuned to the Flash's very own vibrational wavelength. The Flash blocks and deflects the shot. Doctor Light fills the room with a barrage of light needles. The Flash, vibrating back into intangibility, dives up through the roof to dodge Doctor Light's attack. As the Flash descends back into the room, he blocks Doctor Light's next attack by building up a wall of compressed air in front of him. After mercilessly beating Doctor Light into unconsciousness, the Flash recovers the stolen jewelry. In conversation with Perkins, after returning his jewels to him, the Flash begins to suspect that Perkins is Beth's father. The Flash, and West, reunite Beth with Perkins. To celebrate the happy turn of events, Allen takes West, and Myles, out to dinner.</p>",,,,,,,False,9394,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4107409-flash171nm9m085.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",171,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-50067/', 'id': 50067, 'name': 'Flash Museum', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-museum/4020-50067/'}]",Here Lies The Flash--Dead And Unburied,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-38240/', 'id': 38240, 'name': 'Sid Greene', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sid-greene/4040-38240/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-171-here-lies-the-flash-dead-and-unburie/4000-9394/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-31815/', 'id': 31815, 'name': 'Justice League of America', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Allen, investigating as the Flash, discovers that the entire populace of Central City is also moving at super-human speed. The Flash consults with a theoretical physicist, Doctor Torrence. From Torrence, the Flash learns that the accelerated citizens will live out their natural lives in a matter of hours. The Flash also discovers that Central City has been cut off from the rest of the world, by a citywide force field.</p><p>The Flash receives a telepathic message from the super-gorilla, Grodd, who takes credit for Central City's dilemma. Grood offers to reverse the time acceleration on Central City, in return for his release from prison. Reluctantly, the Flash breaks Grodd out of his cell, in Gorilla City, and carries him to Central City. True to his world, Grodd slows the citizens down to their normal rate. Grodd commandeers the broadcast networks of the world, and threatens to speed up time across the globe, unless he is made ruler of the Earth. The Flash receives word, from Torrence, that the accelerated time phenomena resulted from an extraordinary radiation burst from the sun.</p><p>Grodd had nothing to do with the once-in-a-lifetime event, merely taking advantage of it. The Flash confronts Grodd, in the mayor's offices, at City Hall. Grodd telekinetically draws the Flash into his grip, then crushes him, until all that's left is the Flash's uniform. In truth, the Flash vibrated out of his uniform, and Grodd's grasp. Hammering away at the simian super-villain, the Flash defeats Grodd, then carries him back to Gorilla City, for imprisonment. West waves away the reason why her husband was the only man unaffected by the speed-up, citing his extreme laziness as the probable cause.</p><p>Reprinted in <a href=""https://www.comicvine.com/super-heroes-battle-super-gorillas-1/4000-384556/"" data-ref-id=""4000-384556""><em>Super-Heroes Battle Super-Gorillas #1</em></a>.</p><h3>The Machine-Made Robbery!</h3><p>A trio of crooks trick the absent-minded Professor Ira West into allowing them access to his new computer. West demonstrates the prescient power of the computer by asking it to calculate the ideal mate for his wedded daughter, Picture News reporter, Iris West. The computer determines that the Flash is the perfect man for West's daughter. Unbeknownst to West, his daughter is actually already married to the Flash, in his civilian identity of police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. The crooks pay a small fee to lease West's computer, then depart.</p><p>After they've gone, West remembers that certain adjustments have to be periodically made, to keep the computer operating properly. West gets a message to the Flash, via police headquarters. West explains his dilemma in contacting the men who borrowed his computer. West spies one of the men across the street. The Flash heads out to intercept the man, eventually locating him inside a nearby building. Discovering that the man, along with his two associates, are in the process of robbing a vault, the Flash moves in to arrest them.</p><p>The Flash is seconds away from taking the thieves down, when a lucky cane strike fells him. The crooks flee, before the Flash can recover. While in pursuit of the criminals, the Flash finds himself running out of control, due to his head injury. Pulling himself together long enough to run their getaway car off the road, the Flash apprehends the three crooks. The Flash returns West's computer to him. West reveals that his computer chose the Flash as the ideal man for his daughter. The Flash reminds the absent-minded West that his daughter is already married. A knowing smile crosses the Flash's face, acknowledging that West's computer picked the right man.</p><h3> </h3>",,,,,,,False,9525,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/8624-1995-9525-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",172,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55839/', 'id': 55839, 'name': 'Gorilla City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gorilla-city/4020-55839/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55685/', 'id': 55685, 'name': 'Washington D.C.', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/washington-dc/4020-55685/'}]",Grodd Puts the Squeeze On Flash!; The Machine-Made Robbery!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-38240/', 'id': 38240, 'name': 'Sid Greene', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sid-greene/4040-38240/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-172-grodd-puts-the-squeeze-on-flash-the-/4000-9525/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Joan wants Jay to convince police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, to reveal his secret identity, as the Flash, to his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West. Upon arriving at the Allens, the Garricks find that Barry has taken West's nephew, Wally West, to a movie. Wally returns without Barry, much to Jay's concern. While Joan engages Iris in some girl talk, Jay leads Wally out to the balcony. Jay reveals that he is the Golden Age Flash. Wally explains Barry's absence.</p><p>The two were on their way to the theater when Allen spied the elusive Domino Gang, fleeing the foreign exchange. Allen and West, as the Flash and Kid Flash, moved in to apprehend the gang. The Scarlet Speedsters were seconds away from rounding up the entire gang, when the Flash was struck by a beam of energy, and vanished. The force of the beam stunned Kid Flash, long enough for the Domino Gang to escape. Garrick arranges to meet with West later.</p><p>Garrick and West, as the Golden Age Flash and Kid Flash, scour Central City, in search of the Flash. As the two Flashes are about to cross paths, a beam of energy strikes Kid Flash, and he, too, vanishes. Kid Flash finds himself transported to the planet, Vorvan. His captor, the Golden Man, a natural mutation, possesses a towering intellect, forever setting him apart from the savage primitives that inhabit Vorvan. After single-handedly building his technologically advanced Vorvan City, the Golden Man grew bored.</p><p>A passion for hunting inspired the Golden Man to bring the Scarlet Speedsters to Vorvan, to serve as his prey. Releasing the Scarlet Speedsters into the wilds of Vorvan, the Golden Man offers to return them to Earth, if they can elude him for four hours. The Scarlet Speedsters find their flight across the Vorvan landscape quickly interrupted, when they are caught up in a powerful geyser. The constant undulation of the water's surface make it impossible for the Scarlet Speedsters to make any headway.</p><p>The Golden Man closes in on his prey, leveling a paralysis rifle on them, Before he can fire, the two Flashes vibrate down into the geyser, then tear off at such high velocity, they are rendered invisible to the naked eye. The two Flashes are caught in a torrential downpour. The raindrops crystallize upon contact with their skin, weighing and slowing them down. Once more, the Golden Man closes in on them. The two Flashes break for a dense thicket, using the twigs and bushes to scrape away the crystals from their bodies.</p><p>Once more, the Scarlet Speedsters are able to escape the Golden Man. In truth, though, the Golden Man is not actually interested in the hunt. Chasing the Scarlet Speedsters is merely a ruse to keep them running at their highest velocity. Machines in Vorvan City are absorbing the speed force created by their running, which the Golden Man plans to harness, and use, to rapidly evolve his people to his intellectual level. The very ground itself liquifies beneath the Scarlet Speedster's pounding feet.</p><p>Caught in an ever deepening quagmire, Kid Flash begins to go under, passing out from the extreme effort to keep his head above the surface. The Flash lifts, and hurls, Kid Flash to solid ground, but the effort drives him below the quagmire's surface. The Golden Man collects Kid Flash, and returns to Vorvan City. As Kid Flash, alone, cannot generate enough speed force to power his machines, the Golden Man teleports the Golden Age Flash to Vorvan.</p><p>The Golden Man is surprised to find that the Golden Age Flash was not rendered unconscious upon arrival, as the Flash and Kid Flash had been. The Golden Age Flash attacks the Golden Man, but is quickly subdued. The Golden Age Flash and Kid Flash are placed in a radiation cell. Inside the cell, the temperature is rapidly decreased into subzero range. Only by vibrating at their highest velocity can the two speedsters keep themselves from freezing to death.</p><p>Kid Flash is on the verge of passing out, again, from the exertion of sustaining such high velocity, when the Flash storms Vorvan City. The Flash tears into the Golden Man's control console, until the power flickers out on the radiation cell. The three Scarlet Speedsters lunge at the Golden Man, only to be repelled by his superior force of mind. By vibrating in sync with the Flash's specific vibrational frequency, the Golden Age Flash and Kid Flash are able to boost the Flash's speed, with their own.</p><p>The Flash breaks through the Golden Man's telekinetic field and begins mercilessly pummeling him. Hoping to create an army of golden men to fight at his side, the Golden Man activates his machine. Instead of evolving the Vorvan populace to his level, the machine's energy devolves the Golden Man to theirs. The now primitive Golden Man wanders out of Vorvan City, to be with his people.

And Barry reveals his secret identity to Iris.</em></p><p>Sam Scudder, the notorious Mirror Master, sits in his prison cell, polishing a shaving mirror. Suddenly an image appears in the looking glass, of a parallel world, one where the Flash is a super-villain, and the Mirror Master is the hero of Central City. Of particular interest to Scudder, is the mirror weapon his parallel counterpart uses, to subdue the evil Flash. Scudder uses his mastery of mirrors to teleport out of his cell, using the sun's rays reflected on the shaving mirror. Certain that his counterpart's mirror weapon is the key to finally destroying the Flash, Scudder builds an exact replica of it.</p><p>Wanting to share his triumph, Scudder, as the Mirror Master, sets about to freeing the rest of the Flash's Rogues' Gallery. Inspired by a method last used by the super-gorilla, <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/gorilla-grodd/4005-2380/"" data-ref-id=""4005-2380"">Grodd</a>, the Mirror Master uses a special mirror to exchange the places of the rogues with innocent civilians, freeing them all from prison. Holding court over the Rogues, the Mirror Master explains his surefire method for destroying the Flash. Meanwhile, Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, and his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, make plans to celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary.</p><p>Allen intends to reveal his secret identity, as the Flash, to his wife, at their lunch date. Allen overhears a police broadcast regarding a crime being committed by the Rogues. Allen heads out to confront the Rogues, as the Flash. The Flash is surprised to find the Rogues seemingly waiting for him to arrive. The Mirror Master unleashes his new weapon, which completely fails to have any effect on the Flash. The Flash is seconds away from defeating the Rogues, when Captain Cold lays down an ice sheath across the floor. Unable to slow his momentum, the Flash skids into the wall, knocking himself out.</p><p>The Rogues take the opportunity to flee. In the interest of discovering what went wrong, the Mirror Master enters the mirror world. The Mirror Master seeks out the evil Flash, and releases him from prison. The Mirror Master then warns his heroic counterpart that the Flash is on the loose. The Mirror Master observes as his counterpart, once again, subdues the Flash. Understanding better how the mirror weapon works, the Mirror Master returns to his world. The Rogues throw down the gauntlet. The Flash races to confront the Rogues, and falls prey to the Mirror Master's mirror weapon.</p><p>In reality, though, the Flash that confronts the Rogues is the evil Flash from the parallel dimension. Having gotten ahold of the Mirror Master's body swapping mirror, the evil parallel Flash has exchanged places with his heroic counterpart. The Flash's super-speed is stolen by the Mirror Master's mirror weapon, allowing the other Rogues to bring their weapons to bear on their ""old foe"". Meanwhile, the Flash determines that his teleportation into his counterparts's cell has weakened it's defenses. Escaping through the wall he came through, the Flash tracks the energy signature of the body swapping mirror back to his own reality.</p><p>Seeing the Rogues about to murder the evil Flash, the Flash barrels through them, allowing the sonic boom that follows in his wake to render them all unconscious. The Flash turns all the Rogues over to the proper authorities, as well as returning his evil dopppelganger to his proper dimension. At lunch, the Flash, as Allen, reveals his secret identity to West. Allen is stunned to learn that West has known since their wedding night, as Allen talks about his adventures as the Flash, in his sleep.</p>",,,,,,,False,9726,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4017668-tn174.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",174,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56078/', 'id': 56078, 'name': 'Mirror World', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-world/4020-56078/'}]",Stupendous Triumph of the Six Super-Villians!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58438/', 'id': 58438, 'name': ""Captain Boomerang's Boomerangs"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-boomerangs-boomerangs/4055-58438/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58440/', 'id': 58440, 'name': ""Heat Wave's Flamethrower"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heat-waves-flamethrower/4055-58440/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58436/', 'id': 58436, 'name': 'Mirror Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-gun/4055-58436/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58441/', 'id': 58441, 'name': ""Top's Trick Tops"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tops-trick-tops/4055-58441/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-38240/', 'id': 38240, 'name': 'Sid Greene', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sid-greene/4040-38240/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-174-stupendous-triumph-of-the-six-super-/4000-9726/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, responds, as the Flash. Wielding a lightning rod he's prepared, for just such an occasion, the Flash races to install it at the power station, before the Weather Wizard's lightning bolt can strike. The lightning bolt, though, is intercepted by Superman. After defeating the Weather Wizard, the Flash demands to know why Superman intervened on his case. Superman replies that he was merely responding to the Flash's emergency signal. The Flash, however, sent no such signal. The next day, Superman, as Daily Planet reporter, Clark Kent, spies a gangland execution about to go down.</p><p>Kent changes into his Superman costume, and hurls himself in front of the bullets. The bullets never strike him, though, as the Flash has already caught them all. After defeating the mobsters, Superman demands to know why the Flash has intervened on <em>his</em> case. The Flash replies that <em>he</em> was merely responding to Superman's emergency signal. Superman, however, sent no such signal. The two heroes receive an emergency signal to convene at the headquarters of the Justice League of America. Upon arrival, the entire team is assembled. No member, though, sent any such signal. The culprits are revealed to be Rokk and Sorban, alien gamblers from the planet Ventura. Having drawn on a previous bet to determine who was faster, the Flash or Superman, the Venturans have decided to force the two heroes to race again.</p><p>At stake, is the destruction of either Central City or Metropolis, depending on who wins the race. Having heard enough, the Green Lantern lunges at the Venturans, only to be immobilized by bands of yellow energy. J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter, is imprisoned inside a cage of fire. Wonder Woman is bound by her own lasso. Aquaman is paralyzed by his own shower. The remaining members, including team mascot, Snapper Carr, also find themselves bound by bands of yellow energy. The Venturans provide the Flash with an aura of breathable air, so that he can race against Superman, in outer space. Nearing a solar system surrounding a red star, Superman is forced to veer off, giving up valuable ground to the Flash. On his detour, Superman passes Ventura.</p><p>Scanning the planet's surface, Superman spies an enormous erupting volcano. Something else catches the Man of Steel's eye, that changes the nature of the race.The Flash encounters a derelict space craft. Boarding it to offer aid to it's alien crew, the Flash stumbles into a trap. Within moments, the Flash begins to suffocate. All at once, oxygen begins to surround the space around him. Revived, the Flash quickly vibrates out of the craft. The alien vessel turns out to actually be an alien plant, that lures it's victims to it with lifelike illusions, so that it may breathe in expelled carbon dioxide. When Sorban expresses outrage that the Flash has escaped the plant's deathtrap, the Green Lantern grows suspicious of his motivations. Afterall, Sorban is betting on the Flash to win.</p><p>Superman catches up with the Flash and signals him to end the race. Believing that Superman is trying to trick him, the Flash refuses. Before Superman can fully state his case, a kryptonite meteor shower drives him away. Using the meteors as stepping stones, the Flash proceeds down the race course. Suddenly, Rokk and Sorban are attacked by Superman. The Venturans quickly expose Superman to Gold Kryptonite, forever removing his super-powers. Superman, though, turns out to be the Martian Manhunter. J'onn J'onzz took on Superman's form to escape the flame cage, only to be revealed, by exposure to the Gold Kryptonite. Though the Martian Manhunter will never be able to assume Superman's form again, he is able to quickly use Martian science to transform the gold kryptonite to lead, before he can be put back into the flame cage.</p><p>The last meteor the Flash uses as a stepping stone turns out to have the properties of quicksand. Superman knocks the Flash into the atmosphere of a nearby world, causing the meteor to burn up in re-entry, freeing the Flash. Once more Superman attempts to convince the Flash to end the race, but the Scarlet Speedster, again, refuses. The Flash is suddenly attacked by a pair of alien patrol ships. Superman disables them with his heat vision. The effort to stay ahead of the Man of Steel has exhausted the Flash. Realizing that Superman never tires, the Flash throws in the towel. Taking respite on a nearby planet, the despondent Flash despairs over the inevitable destruction of Central City, when Superman wins the race.</p><p>Suddenly, the Flash receives a most amazing message. Superman is caught in a powerful space vortex. Using his heat vision, Superman burns a distress call in front of the Flash. The Scarlet Speedster rescues Superman, then both men finish the race. Depending on the angle of the monitors, it is impossible to tell for certain which man wins the race. Some monitors show Superman. Others indicate the Flash. Returning to Justice League of America headquarters, Superman and the Flash take down Rokk and Sorban, who are revealed to actually be Professor Zoom and Abra Kadabra. Superman realized the Venturans were imposters when he spied the real Rokk and Sorban on Ventura.</p><p>The Green Lantern used the full reserve of his power ring, to boost Aquaman's telepathic power to command sea life, to get a message to the Flash, via alien fish, that the race was rigged. With the two villains defeated, the Justice League of America is left to debate just who the victor of the race was, Superman or the Flash.</p>",,,,,,,False,9789,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/8866-1995-9789-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",175,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41184/', 'id': 41184, 'name': 'Metropolis', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/metropolis/4020-41184/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56257/', 'id': 56257, 'name': 'Secret Sanctuary', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/secret-sanctuary/4020-56257/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56254/', 'id': 56254, 'name': 'Space', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/space/4020-56254/'}]",The Race To The End Of The Universe!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Bat-Suit', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bat-suit/4055-55745/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56367/', 'id': 56367, 'name': 'Gold Kryptonite', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gold-kryptonite/4055-56367/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-32213/', 'id': 32213, 'name': 'Kryptonite', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kryptonite/4055-32213/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41435/', 'id': 41435, 'name': 'Lasso of Truth', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57175/', 'id': 57175, 'name': ""Weather Wizard's Wand"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/weather-wizards-wand/4055-57175/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51517/', 'id': 51517, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Bracelets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-bracelets/4055-51517/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51489/', 'id': 51489, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Tiara"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42397/', 'id': 42397, 'name': 'E.

Professor Ira West goes to a memory workshop and encounters a crook who wants to find some buried loot.</em></p><h3>Death Stalks The Flash!</h3><p>Picture News reporter, Iris West, is deathly ill. When her husband, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, overhears a police bulletin, he investigates, as the Flash. The police have surrounded escaped convict, Dan Bolton. The Flash moves in first, to prevent the loss of lives. After evading Bolton's hail of bullets, the Flash quickly puts Bolton down. Returning to his wife's bedside, the Flash, as Allen, learns that her condition has worsened.West has slipped into a coma. In her delirium, she cries out for the Flash to save himself from death.</p><p>When West's fever has still not broken by morning, Allen decides to take action, as the Flash. Moving at multi-light speed, the Flash literally runs into West's dream. There, in the eerie nightmare realm, the Flash sees himself being menaced by Death. Merging with his dream self, the Flash races away from Death. No matter how fast he runs, though, Death is ever on his heels. Changing tactics, the Flash imprisons Death behind a curtain of super-compressed air, but Death easily walks right through the barrier.</p><p>Fighting back, the Flash notices that Death shies away from one of his blows, before it ever connects. The Flash quickly discovers that at a certain vibratory rate, his fists give off light. Death seems to be recoiling from the light. Constantly changing his vibratory frequency, the Flash pummels Death with the entire color spectrum of light. Death is vanquished, but not before assuring the Flash that, one day, Death will catch up with him. Returning to the waking world, the Flash, as Allen, finds his wife's fever has broken, and she's well on her way to recovering.</p><h3>""Professor West--Lost, Strayed, Or Stolen?""</h3><p>Having grown weary of Professor Ira West's absent-minded shenanigans, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, and his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, enroll the Professor in a memory enhancement class. The instructor, Doctor Binzo, has everyone in the class focus on trying to remember one forgotten thing. West focuses on a fellow classmate, certain that he's seen the man before. Outside, West's classmate approaches some shady looking characters on a bench. The man reports that he has failed to remember where he buried the stolen money, from a prior robbery.</p><p>West approaches the group and declares that he remembers where he knows the man from. While out on a walk, West had seen the man burying something, in the woods near Central University. The crooks ask West to accompany them to the exact spot. After digging up their lost loot, the crooks continue digging and widening the hole, to bury West. Still oblivious to his peril, or the true nature of the men he's accompanied, West blithely babbles on about how improved his memory has become. Worried over her father's long absence, Iris sends her husband out to look for West, as the Flash.</p><p>Following a signal in West's watch, placed there for just such a situation, the Flash catches up with West, just as the crooks are gunning him down. The Flash blows the bullets into a tree, then topples the tree over on the crooks. Back at home, the Allens quickly discover that they may have been better off before, when West's memory was so faulty. Now the old Professor won't cease rambling on about every single detail he can remember, about the minutia of his life.</p><h3>Open The Door, Earthman!</h3><p>This story was originally published in <ins><a href=""/mystery-in-space-34/4000-2707/"" data-ref-id=""4000-2707"">Mystery In Space</a></ins> #34 (October, 1956).

West and Allen are about to begin a day of sightseeing, when the Eiffel Tower suddenly launches into orbit. When an alarm clock in their hotel room also rises to the ceiling, Allen suspects a powerful magnetic force has stolen the Eiffel Tower. Allen contacts Inspector Martell, of Interpol, to share his theory. Martell informs Allen that the Empire State Building and the Tokyo Radio Tower have also been drawn into space. Allen joins Martell at the former site of the Eiffel Tower.</p><p>A powerful storm opens up on Paris. Allen is nearly electrocuted, when the severed cable he is holding is struck by lightning. Martell receives word that the Radio-Telescope Space Station, on the outskirts of Paris, has been destroyed by lightning. From Saturn's moon, Titan, aliens Yamar and Konar, having disabled radio communications across the Earth, launch their ""Intellimessengers"" to establish contact with the populace. West arrives at the former site of the Eiffel Tower, looking for her husband. Just as she's being told that Allen took off with Martell, an Intellimessenger passes overhead, and draws her inside of it.</p><p>Martell informs Allen that West has been abducted. Martell races for the former site of the Eiffel Tower, but Allen remains behind. Allen races to West's rescue, as the Flash. The Flash accelerates his molecular structure to near intangibility, to penetrate the hull of the Intellimessenger. Despite his efforts, the Flash slams into the hull, and careens off, unconscious, into the street. The French army opens up on the Intellimessenger, only to see it's tanks pulled into the sky by a powerful magnetic field. With their tanks destroyed, the French army is faced with defeat.</p><p>France's criminal element, however, led by Le Loup, sees an opportunity in the making. A door opens up in the Intellimessenger. Yamar and Konar descend down a ramp, speaking unintelligible gibberish. The Flash takes this opportunity to race, invisibly, into the Intellimessenger. After ascertaining that his wife is okay, the Flash sets out to communicate with the aliens. Le Loup, using a band of Hippies to conceal his criminal forces, approaches the Intellimessenger. As soon as they've reached the bottom of the ramp, Le Loup's gang aim weapons at Yamar and Konar.</p><p>The Flash rescues the aliens, as the Parisian authorities move in to arrest Le Loup, and his criminal associates. Having earned the alien's trust, the Flash is able to correct the flaw in the aliens' translator, allowing them to communicate. The aliens are only interested in preventing the Earth from continuing to send radio signals to their world, which have been causing magnetic upheavals of disastrous consequence.

Allen, as the Flash, uses his Cosmic Treadmill to travel to the 23rd Century. Returning seconds later, the Flash seems noticeably well-rested. Then he collapses. West gets the Flash, as Allen, to a hospital. Allen slips into a coma, leaving the doctors baffled as to the cause of his condition. Meanwhile, in the 25th Century, Eobard Thawne, the notorious Professor Zoom, sits in his cell, watching old gangster movies. Thawne is contacted by Sargon The Sorcerer, and offered a chance at escape. Sargon draws Thawne back in time, to the 20th Century.</p><p>After handing Thawne his Reverse-Flash costume, Sargon reveals that, after spending the last two decades fighting crime, he wishes to pursue a more villainous path. Sargon asks Professor Zoom to reveal the secrets of time travel to him. Professor Zoom refuses, and races away at super-human speed. With the power of his Ruby of Life, Sargon pulls the bones of the Flash from some future grave, into the present. The Flash's skeleton is found in a hole by a trio of young boys. Sargon reveals to Professor Zoom that he has slain the Flash, thinking that, without purpose, Professor Zoom will teach him the ways of time travel. Professor Zoom again refuses, and speeds away.</p><p>Moving faster than the human eye can see, Professor Zoom trails West to the coroner's office. When West identifies the bones as actually belonging to the Flash, she breaks down in tears. Convinced of the Flash's death, Professor Zoom returns to Sargon. Instead of revealing the secret to traveling in time, Professor Zoom tricks the sorcerer into condemning himself to the netherworld, Chimano. With the Flash no longer a threat, Professor Zoom embarks on a crime spree that will span five centuries, and cover the entire globe. Allen awakes from his come, and departs the hospital. Donning his Flash costume, Allen is just about to race for home, when he collapses again.</p><p>Upon regaining consciousness, the Flash hails a taxi, to carry him home. Overhearing that Professor Zoom is at large, the Flash exits the cab, and races off after his evil counterpart, only to suddenly disappear. Sargon the Sorcerer, using his Ruby of Life, has called the Flash to him. With the Flash holding onto the Ruby of Life, the Scarlet Speedster is able to align his, and Sargon's, vibrational frequencies with that of the mortal realm, allowing them to escape Chimano, and return to Central City. Sargon passes out from the effort. The Flash tracks down Professor Zoom, outside the Flash Museum.</p><p>The Reverse Flash hurls the loot, that he's gathered from around the planet, at the Flash. Using a shrink ray, Professor Zoom miniaturizes the Flash. With the Flash his prisoner, Professor Zoom continues his centuries spanning crime spree, ending in the 25th Century. Using the Ruby of Life, which he's been holding onto the entire time, the Flash escapes. After quickly defeating the Reverse-Flash, the Flash regains his normal stature, and returns to his proper century. Sargon vows to take back the Ruby of Life from the Flash. Having been cured of the disease he picked up, on vacation in the 23rd Century, an exhausted Flash, as Allen, returns home, and collapses into bed. Much to the chagrin of West, who is ready to start <em>her</em> vacation.</p>",,,,,,,False,10075,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/9121-1995-10075-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",186,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Time Times Three Equals--?,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-43295/', 'id': 43295, 'name': 'Ruby of Life', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ruby-of-life/4055-43295/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9070/', 'id': 9070, 'name': 'Mike Esposito', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-esposito/4040-9070/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-51799/', 'id': 51799, 'name': 'Mike Friedrich', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-friedrich/4040-51799/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'penciler'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-186-time-times-three-equals/4000-10075/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

A group of gangsters come out and try to shoot him but he knocks them all down in a flash.</p><p>It seems Dr. Maybrook's assistant used his color tricks to rob all the people without him knowing. Barry asks him again about his green vision and finds out that Maybrook was testing his show one night and the radiation it caused, accidentally hit Barry when he changing his uniform on the street nearby. So when he used the uniform again, the radiation came out too and cause his green-sightedness.

Letter to the editor from comics writer Mark Evanier.</em></p><p>Barry, Iris and Wally are on vacation near Blue Valley, on a little cottage on a hill that seems to shine blue. Wally gives Iris some scares by telling her the place is haunted. To start a fire, Barry and Wally become Flash and Kid Flash to quickly collect some wood. Wally explains that the hill only seems blue from a distance and tells of an old Indian legend that said blue lizards came from the sky and landed on that hill. A professor in town believes this lizards were aliens who cannot be seen because they are in another dimension, so that only a blue haze can be seen.</p><p>When Barry and Wally do a contest on finding a four-leaf clover, Wally stumbles upon one of the blue aliens, but notices that he only he sees it when he is using the speed force. Wally tries to capture the alien it escapes but not before putting some fog on Wally that makes him feel strange. He and Barry go back to the cottage. When they arrive, Barry accidentally vibrates through Iris and their parakeet Chippy. Chippy is suddenly aging very fast and soon enough the same happens to Iris. They bring her to a hospital.</p><p>Barry feels guilty and wants to abandon his Flash personality. Wally tries to tell him about the alien, but Barry doesn't listen. But when he hears that Iris is turning blue, he takes Wally to find the blue creature again. They find a gigantic spaceship from which an army of blue aliens exits and starts shooting at them. They fight but then the aliens use a weapon that captures Wally with some kind of magnetic force. Just when Barry destroys the machine, blue light appears and both are captured on the spaceship which then leaves earth. The grand patriarch of the Azurans, explains to them that their race has been coming to earth for eons to die. Their journey is responsible for the blue radiation that causes Iris' aging but they can't have anyone interfer with their traditions. By using their protective aura, Barry and Wally escape but some force keeps Kid Flash from moving on. They figure out that Barry has to run through Wally to age him, so he can use adult strength to move on. Now they are able to defeat the Azurans and bring the ship back to Earth. The Azurans give them an antidote that reverses the aging process for Iris and Wally and promise never to come to Earth again.</p>",,,,,,,False,10236,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3542255-tn.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",189,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}]",The Death-Touch of the Blue Ghost,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9070/', 'id': 9070, 'name': 'Mike Esposito', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-esposito/4040-9070/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'penciler'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-189-the-death-touch-of-the-blue-ghost/4000-10236/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Ten Years to Live—One Second to Die!</em></p><h4>Super-Speed Agent Of The Flash</h4><p>Alerted to the threat of a tornado, on the outskirts of Central City, the Flash generates a counter-whilrwind, to dissipate the tornado. Though the Flash's gambit proves successful, he suffers a career crippling injury. Though his broken leg will, eventually, heal, the doctor tells the Flash he will never run again. Picture News reporter, Iris West, offers to drive the Flash to police headquarters. En route, a deep depression overcomes the Flash, who asks West to just take him home. In the weeks that follow, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, recuperates in solitude, as a massive crime wave sweeps over Central City.</p><p>Finally, West forces Allen to listen to the latest police bulletins. Hearing that the Muscle Men Mob is back in Central City, Allen decides to bring them in. Allen has West sew his Flash costume airtight, while he builds a series of miniature transmitters to be laced throughout the suit. Inflating the suit with a portion of the speed force, Allen is able to create a radio-controlled automaton, out of his costume. Vibrating faster than the eye can see, Allen scours the city in search of the Muscle Man Mob. Discovering them looting a jewelry store, Allen directs the Flash automaton into confronting them.</p><p>The battle is going well until a stray gunshot punctures the airtight costume, releasing Allen's speed force. Allen orders the costume to return to him. It is just able to reach him, before it collapses. The Muscle Man Mob surround the ""Flash"". Allen, still vibrating invisibly, is able to effect repairs on the costume, and reanimate it, before the gang can reach them. With the Muscle Man Mob put out of action, Allen's confidence as a crime fighter is restored. The doctor informs the Flash that, thanks to his super-speed vibrations, his leg is healing properly, and that he will, in fact, be able to run again.</p><h3><ins>""Ten Years To Live-- One Second To Die!""</ins></h3><p>The Flash donates his crutches, wheelchair, and cast to the Flash Museum. The curator of the Flash Museum, Dexter Myles, asks the Flash for help with a new employee, Joel Travis. Seems Travis has fallen in with a bad bunch, called the ""Far-Outers"". When Travis bragged about his close personal friendship with the Flash, the Far-Outers asked for Travis to get the Flash to appear at one of their meetings. Wanting to save face, Travis stole one of the Flash's costumes from the museum, and went to attend the meeting, as the Flash.</p><p>Knowing how dangerous it is to impersonate him, the Flash races to the Far-Outers' meeting place. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash discovers that the Far-Outers, believing that Travis is the Flash, have taken him prisoner. Still moving invisibly, the Flash spirits Travis to safety, then takes his place. The Far-Outers carry the Flash's ""unconscious"" body to the estate of ""Blue Chip"" Chipman, a white collar criminal the Flash put away for 10 years. After the Flash has ""recovered"", Chipman directs his attention to an old hotel, visible through the Flash's cell window.</p><p>The entire top of the hill the hotel rests upon explodes. Chipman has planted 10 explosive devices throughout Central City, all of which will detonate if the Flash steps one foot outside of his cell. Moving faster than he ever has before, the Flash tracks down Chipman's explosive devices, by following the electronic signal of his detonator. The Flash locates and deactivates all of Chipman's bombs, then beats the man himself, into unconsciousness, all within the span of a single second. After lecturing Travis on the foolishness of his actions, the Flash recommends to Myles that Travis keep his job at the Flash Museum.</p>",,,,,,,False,10334,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/9362-1995-10334-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",190,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-50067/', 'id': 50067, 'name': 'Flash Museum', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-museum/4020-50067/'}]",Super-Speed Agent Of The Flash,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9434/', 'id': 9434, 'name': 'Joe Kubert', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-kubert/4040-9434/', 'role': 'penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9070/', 'id': 9070, 'name': 'Mike Esposito', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-esposito/4040-9070/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'penciler'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-190-super-speed-agent-of-the-flash/4000-10334/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

West has set up Jordan on something of a blind date, for dinner. The trio are joined by Jordan's rival toy seller, Olivia Reynolds. Though Jordan is harboring some hard feelings towards Reynolds, for beating him on a sales contract, Jordan makes the best of it. Surprisingly, Jordan finds Reynolds very engaging, a big change from their previous encounter. To find out why, Jordan uses his power ring, invisibly, to probe Reynolds thoughts.</p><p>Immediately, Jordan's probe feeds back on him. Jordan and Allen excuse themselves from the dinner table, to discuss the Reynolds situation. Outside, on the street, the pair see an alien space craft landing in the city. Allen and Jordan investigate, as the Flash and the Green Lantern. A robot invasion force releases horrific bug-eyed monsters on the heroic duo. With every blow the heroes land, the creatures divide into two. Changing tactics, the two heroes opt to cease their attack, revealing the creatures to be mere illusion.</p><p>While the Flash deals with the robot army, the Green Lantern inspects their weaponry, and discovers that their guns are mere toys. The robot army links arms, generating a powerful energy pulse that renders the two heroes unconscious. Onboard the alien craft, the historian, Glabr, makes a record of his mission in the ship's log. Long ago, Glabr's race found themselves losing the very essence of their life energy. A brilliant scientist, Jygr, determined that certain beings, on other worlds, could generate enough life essence, from their subconscious minds, to sustain their race.</p><p>Reynolds has been discovered to possess this ""U-MInd"". As it is imperative that the possessor never know of the power their own minds possess, it was actually Glabr who repelled Jordan's mind probe, earlier that evening. Glabr then staged the alien invasion to keep the two heroes occupied, while they finished their tests on Reynolds' U-Mind. Glabr is interrupted by one of the robot soldiers, known as Mogrians. The Mogrian informs Glabr's home world, Lengly, that they are rebelling. Glabr is pushed to the side, as the Mogrians set about building machines to mass produce themselves.</p><p>Green Lantern, as Jordan, wakes up next to the Flash's empty costume. Suddenly, the Flash, as Allen rounds the corner, wearing Green Lantern's costume. Glabr approaches the two heroes and explains the entire situation to them. After putting their proper uniforms on, the Flash and the Green Lantern are just about to confront the Mogrians, when they realize they no longer have their powers. Glabr realizes that it is Reynold's U-Mind which has robbed them of their powers, and only she can restore them. Glabr attempts to telepathically access Reynolds' U-Mind, only to find that she is a prisoner of the Mogrians.</p><p>The Flash and the Green lantern add their will power to Glabr's, and make contact with Reynolds' subconscious. Glabr gently persuades Reynolds' U-Mind to restore the two heroes. The Flash and the Green Lantern storm the alien ship, and engage the Mogrians in combat.

He defeats the soldiers and disables their subs, and the Trident is able to leave. Phyllis waits for him because she is slowly dying from the gas she was exposed to on Captain Vulcan's sub. As Flash is desperately running as fast as he can back to the lighthouse carrying Phyllis, he sees Phyllis's spirit walking on the water toward the lighthouse and then he sees Phil's spirit walking out to join her.

A patrol from the prison encounters a group of young men, dressed as land surveyors. Unbeknownst to the prison guards, these men <em>are</em> the escaped convicts. Each man has been regressed in age, by the notorious Captain Cold. The Frosty Felon takes the crooks back to his secret lair. The walls of Captain Cold's abode are decorated with pictures of one-time screen queen, Laura Lamont. Captain Cold intends to restore Lamont's youth, then marry her. In the meantime, the now youthful criminals are to loot Central City, to supply Captain Cold with wedding presents for his soon-to be bride.</p><p>The only catch is that Lamont is a recluse, whose whereabouts are known only to Picture News reporter, Iris West. Captain Cold approaches West in the guise of J.J.Pendergast, a lawyer. ""Representing"" an unnamed client, ""Pendergast"" informs West that a small fortune has been willed to Lamont. West still refuses to divulge Lamont's location. West heads out to inform Lamont of Pendergast's offer. Pendergast, surreptitiously, pursues West. Suspicious of Pendergast, West's husband, police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, pursues them both, as the Flash. Having waited too long to head after them, the Flash loses their trail. Suddenly, the Flash is floored by a sonic blast.</p><p>Entering the building the blast emanated from, the Flash encounters two of Captain Cold's men, stealing a painting. Still somewhat unsteady on his feet, the Flash is hit at point blank range by the sonic weapon. The sonics speed up the Flash's vibratory rate, causing him to fade away, into another dimension. Concentrating, the Flash manages to slow his vibratory rate down, becoming solid enough to beat the crooks into unconsciousness. Turning the crooks over to the police, the Flash learns that they have the same fingerprints as two of the elderly escaped convicts. The Flash investigates the scene of the escape, and discovers tell-tale evidence of Captain Cold's involvement.</p><p>At first the Flash is able to follow the unique radiation signature of Captain Cold's cold gun, but the trail quickly goes cold. Suspecting that one of the prior night's robberies may have been committed by Captain Cold, the Flash ferrets out a fresher trail. The Flash follows the trail back to Captain Cold's secret lair. With his super-frigid aura slowing the Flash down, Captain Cold has time to attach a special device to his gun, lowering it's emissions to well below absolute zero. Captain Cold blasts the Flash, dismembering his body, as it freezes solid . Captain Cold frames the Flash's body parts, and hangs them on his wall. Captain Cold presents himself to Lamont, and restores her youth.</p><p>Showering her with his wedding gifts, Captain Cold declares his intention to marry Lamont. Captain Cold leaves Lamont to prepare herself for the wedding, while he phones the Justice of the Peace. Absentmindedly, Captain Cold calls Heatwave, instead. Deciding to share his triumph, Captain Cold invites Heatwave over to view the Flash's frozen, dismembered body. Enraged that he never got one last shot at the Flash, Heatwave violently shoves Captain Cold aside, and fires his weapon on the Flash's broken body. The intense heat of Heatwave's gun, thaws and restores the Flash to normal.</p><p>Heatwave and Captain Cold begin struggling against one another, giving the Flash time to fully recover. Back on his feet, the Flash pummels his foes, mercilessly, into unconsciousness. Preferring her anonymity, Lamont uses her theater skills to disguise herself as an old woman, taking a job as a cashier at the local cinema. The Flash, as Allen, reveals to West that he was able to telepathically influence Captain Cold into contacting Heatwave.

Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash separates from Talman, releasing her to her eternal rest. The Flash, though, finds himself trapped in this horrific realm of shades. After being berated by an enormous toad, the Flash is attacked by terrifying demonic creatures.</p><p>The nightmarish abominations melt under the Flash's blows, multiplying in number from every super-speed strike. Exercising the better part of valor, the Flash cuts and runs. Towering monstrosities rain fire upon him, while trying to crush him beneath their heels. The Flash focuses on a fixed point of abject darkness and races for it. En route, he is set upon by harpies. Diving into the cold darkness, the Flash finds himself standing in his living room with West. Boardman wakes up, as if from a trance. Hurriedly, the Flash disposes of his costume, before Boardman can fully see him. The Allens return Boardman to her hotel. Allen recognizes the hotel as the former residence of Talman.</p><h3><ins>The Man Who Televised Time!</ins></h3><p>This story was originally published in <a href=""/strange-adventures-13/4000-126691/"" data-ref-id=""4000-126691"">Strange Adventures #13</a> ( October, 1951).

""Fugitive From Blind Justice"" (Part Two); Flash saves Lightning from being put to sleep after Lighting is accused of killing his master. ""I Open My Mouth...But I Can't Scream""!</em></p><h3>""Fugitive From Blind Justice""</h3><p>The Flash signs autographs, outside of the Jerry Lewis telethon for muscular dystrophy. Racing home through Central City Park, the Flash poses for a photograph. Blinded by the intensity of the flash, the Flash is an easy target for a gang of thugs. The Flash flails about blindly, until he crashes, hard, into a statue of blind justice. The crooks are about to murder the Flash, when a dog enters the fray, and chases the crooks away. Just as suddenly as it appeared, the dog runs away.</p><p>The next morning, the Flash, as police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, reads a headline about how the same dog butchered it's owner, millionaire Philip Bentley. Allen, as the Flash, heads over to the animal detention center, to plead the dog's case. There, the Flash hears a firsthand account, from Bentley's brother, Lee, about how the dog, Lightning, killed his brother. The Flash speaks to the good nature of Lightning's character, citing how Lighting saved his life, on the night of the slaying.</p><p>Unfortunately, because the Flash was blinded at the time, he can produce no corroborating witnesses to the occurrence. The Flash is given 24 hours to prove the dog's good character. The Flash, however, fails to locate either the photographer who blinded him, or the criminals who tried to kill him. In desperation, the Flash frees Lightning from the detention center, and races off with the dog. An hour later, the Flash can see no alternative but to turn Lightning back in for execution.</p><p>Responding to the distress cries of a blind man, the Flash and Lightning save the man from drowning. The Flash leaves Lightning with the blind man, then races to the Bentley Estate, to investigate the scene of the crime. There, the Flash hears the same crook's laughter from the night before. The Flash finds Lee Bentley and notorious mobster Victor Torrance, holding guns on one another. Having conspired to slay his brother with Torrance, Bentley is now refusing to pay Torrance's blackmail demands.</p><p>As the Flash enters the Greenhouse, Bentley fires into a glass display case, releasing the choking poison of the plant housed inside it. Torrance calls for his hired guns. Though fighting incapacitation, the Flash fights valiantly against his attackers. Once again, Lightning comes to the Flash's rescue. During the melee, a dogtooth fringed glove falls out of Torrance's pocket, which is all the evidence the Flash needs to clear Lightning. Lightning is awarded Bentley's entire estate. After providing for the dog's care for life, the Flash, as Allen, donates the rest of the money to muscular dystrophy research. Allen takes over ownership of Lightning.</p><h3>I Open My Mouth... But I Can't Scream!</h3><p>Traumatized during his teenage years, police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, is terrified of riding roller coasters. Despite the many harrowing feats he's been called upon to do, as the Flash, Allen still breaks out in a cold sweat at the thought of riding a roller coaster. Allen's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, gets Allen on a roller coaster, as part of a charity function for the Police Athletic League. Allen immediately goes into a panic attack, made worse when he sees that part of the track has sprung. With his wife's life at a stake, Allen overcomes his fear, with a bloodcurdling scream, and repairs the track, as the Flash. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash is able to effect the repairs and return to the roller coaster car without anyone realizing that Allen ever left.</p>",,,,,,,False,10691,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/9697-1995-10691-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",195,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""Fugitive From Blind Justice""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1764/', 'id': 1764, 'name': 'Gil Kane', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gil-kane/4040-1764/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-51799/', 'id': 51799, 'name': 'Mike Friedrich', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-friedrich/4040-51799/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1768/', 'id': 1768, 'name': 'Neal Adams', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neal-adams/4040-1768/', 'role': 'artist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43530/', 'id': 43530, 'name': 'Robert Kanigher', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/robert-kanigher/4040-43530/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4256/', 'id': 4256, 'name': 'Vince Colletta', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vince-colletta/4040-4256/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-195-fugitive-from-blind-justice/4000-10691/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Moving faster than the eye can follow, Allen is able to stand by his own bedside, as the Flash, while still lying in bed, as Allen. Seeing the Flash and Allen together erases any thoughts Conwell may have, that the Flash is really Allen.</p><h3>""To The Nth Degree""</h3><p>Absentminded professor, Ira West, invents a telescope that can view star systems thousands of light years away, in real time. West sends the telescope to the Astronomical Society, while sending a regular telescope to his son-in-law, police forensic scientist, Barry Allen. By mistake, Allen receives the super-telescope. Allen's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, trains the telescope on a planet orbiting the star, Betelgeuse. The planet is suffering catastrophic upheaval.</p><p>Allen, as the Flash, synchronizes his inner vibrations to that of the ultra-light hitting the telescope's lens, and rides it back to the planet. The gaseous inhabitants beg the Flash for assistance. His blood literally boiling from the planet's surface temperature, the Flash realizes that he will only be able to spend one single minute on this strange, hostile world. Racing down into the very planet itself, the Flash is able to cool the planet's core, restoring the world to normal.</p><p>The Flash races for the ultra-light beam, but West accidentally moves the telescope a few degrees, causing the light beam to shift position. It's now miles away. Pouring on the speed, the Flash chases the light beam across the planet's surface. Throwing a handful of sand in his path, the Flash skips across the grains of sand, and dives into the beam. Professor West arrives to retrieve his telescope, managing to break it, as he lifts it from the tripod.</p><p>Luckily, West wrote all of his equations on the wall at home, so recreating the lens will be no problem. Upon returning home, however, West finds that the painter he forgot he hired, to paint his house, has already covered his equations. West desperately attempts to remember how he created the telescopic lens, to no avail.</p>",,,,,,,False,10781,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/9786-1995-10781-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",197,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""Four Star Super-Hero""/""To The Nth Degree""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1764/', 'id': 1764, 'name': 'Gil Kane', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gil-kane/4040-1764/', 'role': 'penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-51799/', 'id': 51799, 'name': 'Mike Friedrich', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-friedrich/4040-51799/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43530/', 'id': 43530, 'name': 'Robert Kanigher', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/robert-kanigher/4040-43530/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4256/', 'id': 4256, 'name': 'Vince Colletta', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vince-colletta/4040-4256/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-197-four-star-super-hero-to-the-nth-degr/4000-10781/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

""Call It...Magic""!</em></p><h3>No Sad Songs For A Scarlet Speedster!</h3><p>Three teens, Rod Haines, Betty Foster, and Frankie Smith, keep a watchful eye on the Flash. The Scarlet Speedster spends his days hiding out in a cave, mending a bird's wing. To the teenagers' sorrow, the Flash is still an amnesiac with the mind of an 8 year old. Despite their best efforts to convince the Flash of who he really is, the teens can't get through to his damaged mind.</p><p>When the Flash actually tries to move at super-speed, at the teens' urgings, he fails. Hearing a noise in the underbrush, the teens close ranks around the Flash, to protect him from the coming threat. The ""threat"" turns out to merely be a squirrel, who the Flash quickly adopts as a pet. The teens take their leave of the Flash, convincing him to stay hidden away in the cave, as part of a game.</p><p>Two days ago, the Flash had been performing at a local orphanage. The Headmaster asked the Flash to try to get through to a trio of troubled teenagers. At first, the teens treated the Flash with scorn, and rebuffed all of his offers of adventure. Finally, though, they did ask for something... to return to their old neighborhood. Carrying the teens in his slipstream, the Flash brought them to a particularly destitute part of Central City.</p><p>At the teens' request, the Flash began building them a clubhouse. During his super-speed construction efforts, the Flash dug up the missing loot from a recent robbery. Suddenly, armed thugs began firing on the Flash, and the teens. Though the Flash was able to escape, and carry the teens to safety, a stray bullet creased his temple. When he regained consciousness, the Flash's mind, and memories, had regressed to that of a child.</p><p>The gunmen follow the teens back to the cave, hurling in smoke grenades to flush them out. Finding faith in the teenagers' belief in him, the Flash is able to access his super-speed abilities. Taking the crooks down, in an uncontrolled fashion, leads to a cave-in. The Flash takes another blow to the head, from a falling rock, and regains his memories. With the crooks in jail, and the clubhouse finished, an exhausted Flash, finally, returns home, and collapses into bed.</p><h3><ins>Call It... Magic!</ins></h3><p>Zatanna performs in Central City. Using her magic to draw police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, to the stage. Zatanna passionately kisses Allen, as the prelude to her disappearing act. Zatanna, though, is the one who vanishes, not Allen. Zatanna is drawn to another realm, called to the aid of a powerful sorcerer, Namba. Zatanna sees Namba beset by the demon, Xarkon. Before she can act, Xarkon possesses Namba's body.</p><p>Zatanna tries to exorcise Xarkon from Namba, to no avail. Using his Cosmic Treadmill, Allen, as the Flash, is able to follow Zatanna into the other realm. Xarkon's corruption has already spread throughout the realm, thus the Flash is immediately attacked upon arrival. After defeating his attackers, the Flash races along, faster than the eye can see, to avoid further conflicts.</p><p>Finding Zatanna, the Flash closes on Xarkon, only to be immobilized by the demons' magics. Zatanna finally realizes how to break Xarkon's hold over Namba. Passionately kissing Xarkon, drives the demon out of Namba's body. Namba returns the passion of Zatanna's kiss, then sends her back to her own realm. The Flash follows. Reappearing on the stage, as if they had never left, the Flash, as Allen, uses his super-human speed, to complete Zatanna's trick.</p><h3> </h3>",,,,,,,False,10832,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4109402-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21jqfdwnvhup4br%21ye%21bgyw~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",198,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",No Sad Songs For A Scarlet Speedster!/Call It...

""The Explosive Heart of America.""</em></p><h3>""Flash?--Death Calling!""</h3><p>Fast asleep on a park bench, the Flash is awakened by a beat cop. The Flash's death is plastered across the headline of every newspaper covering the Flash. Lost in his grief, the Flash slowly walks away, only to encounter a fleeing thief. The Flash fails to defeat the thief in combat. The thief is, ultimately, apprehended by a pair of baseball players. Forced off a bus for lack of exact change, the Flash continues to wander the street. Picture News reporter, Iris West, spies the Flash on the street, touching off a wave of memories.</p><p>Her husband, police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, had a busy day ahead of him, as the Flash. After attending a meeting of the Justice League of America, the Flash was to be interviewed, alongside Doctor Hollister, on the Davis Goodkind Show. Later that evening, West received a call from the city coroner, informing her that the Flash was dead. His fellow members of the Justice League of America served as pall bearers at the Flash's funeral. West wrenches the mask from the Flash, revealing the face of Doctor Hollister.</p><p>The good doctor, blaming himself for the Flash's death, has taken up the Scarlet Speedster's mantle. Hollister had met the Flash on the Davis Goodkind Show. After the Flash recounted a tale of his rescuing the nuclear submarine, Phaeton, trapped beneath the polar ice, Hollister revealed his progress in the field of suspended animation. That night, Hollister was accosted by a gang of criminals, in his laboratory. Their leader, Keech, demanded to be placed in suspended animation.</p><p>Hollister, having not progressed to human trials yet, refused. The Flash intervened on Hollister's behalf, accidentally being exposed to Hollister's suspended animation formula. Though the Flash was able to round up the criminal gang, immediately afterwards, he collapsed. Finding no pulse, Hollister pronounced him dead on the scene. In the court of public opinion, Hollister is held accountable for the Flash's death. Paying a visit to the Flash Museum, Hollister stole a Flash costume, tearfully donated by West, and donned it himself.</p><p>Hollister, though, proves a sorry substitute for the real Flash. Stooping to grave robbery, Hollister collects the Flash's corpse from it's tomb, and brings it back to his laboratory. Feverishly, he attempts to find a way to bring the Flash back to life. Keech, and his gang, return for the suspended animation formula. A stray bolt of lightning ricochets off Keech's gun, striking the Flash in the chest. Instantly revived, the Flash beats the criminals into unconsciousness. The Flash, as Allen, returns home, to a happy reunion with West.</p><h3><ins>The Explosive Heart Of America!</ins></h3><p>Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, is surprised, in his laboratory, by the mysterious Colonel K, of the U.S. IN-T Agency. Colonel K needs the Flash to take on a top secret mission. When Allen waffles about, regarding contacting the Flash, Colonel K activates the hidden spring in Allen's ring, releasing his compressed Flash costume. Colonel K vanishes, leaving Allen standing there, holding his Flash costume. The Flash scours the Chinese countryside, in search of a hidden missile base. Thanks to a tip from a Chinese youth, the Flash discovers the missile base, hidden inside a mountain.</p><p>The moment the Flash enters, the mountain's defenses are triggered, and the missile launches. The Flash leaps onto the missile, and is carried all the way to the continental United States. The missile zeros in on a giant ""X"", placed in the center of the continent, Smith County, Kansas. The Flash destroys the landing beacon, which causes the missile to dissipate.

Hernandez stands up from his wheelchair, but falls as he takes his first step. Hernandez curses the Flash, blaming the Scarlet Speedster for putting him in the wheelchair. As the Flash exits the hospital, Hernandez's doctor informs him that Hernandez's paralysis is trauma-based. Hernandez could walk, if he only had the will to do so. The Flash's guilt paralyzes him into inactivity, when a group of crooks try to run him over.</p><p>Picture News reporter, Iris West, pulls the Flash to safety. Exiting their car, the crooks attack West and the Flash. The Scarlet Speedster still does nothing to defend himself. Only when he hears West's cries of distress is the Flash moved to action. Within a matter of seconds, the Flash has beaten all of his attackers into unconsciousness. The Flash, and West, continue to wander the streets of Hernandez's neighborhood. The Flash is treated with scorn everywhere he walks.</p><p>A month earlier, West had been assigned to write an article about Hernandez, known as ""El Flash Espanol""( The Spanish Flash), for his lightning swiftness on the basketball court. The Flash joined West, to meet his namesake. The hopes and dreams of Hernandez's family lay with the likely success of Hernandez, on the basketball court. The Flash offered to take Hernandez to see his grandparents, in Puerto Rico. Enroute, the Flash encountered a burning ship.</p><p>Setting Hernandez on the ship's bow, the Flash set to putting out the blaze. While the Flash was fighting the fire, the ship's mast fell upon Hernandez, pinning his legs. By the time the Flash had returned to Hernandez, the boy had been traumatized into believing his legs were crushed. The Flash tries to distract himself from his despair, by fighting crime. In combat with a helicopter gunship, the Flash catches a stray bullet to the temple, temporarily robbing him of his locomotive abilities.</p><p>While the Flash and Hernandez are waiting to see the same doctor, an explosion from the chemical laboratory sets the hospital ablaze. The Flash begs Hernandez to save himself. Slowly, the boy rises from his wheelchair. Still unsteady on his feet, Hernandez drags the Flash away from the fire, to the rooftop. Still trapped by the fire, it falls on the Flash to overcome his own immobility, as Hernandez has done, to save them both. A triumphant Hernandez is re-united with his family, including his grandparents, who West brought in from Puerto Rico.</p><h4>Finale For A Fiddler!</h4><p>Responding to a police bulletin, the Golden Age Flash confronts his old nemesis, the Turtle. Though the Golden Age Flash is able to triumph over his old foe, he finds himself completely winded afterwards. The Golden Age Flash takes his wife to a rock festival, little realizing that his old nemesis, the Fiddler, intends to crash the scene.</p><p>The Fiddler leaps on stage, and begins playing his fiddle. A powerful wave of vibratory energy begins to forcibly repel the audience, including the Golden Age Flash.

Soon after, she phones her husband, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, begging for help. Allen responds, as the Flash. Running all the way to Hollywood, the Flash races to West's last known location, the estate of film director, Robert Paley. The Flash finds a satanic figure burning in effigy on the front lawn, and a masked woman's corpse, floating in the swimming pool.</p><p>After revealing that the corpse is not West, the Flash puts outs the blaze, and enters the Paley estate.The Flash finds Paley, his wife, film crew and cast have all been slaughtered, their faces covered in satanic masks. Graffiti scrawled on the wall reads ""The Satan Circle Was Here"". After determining that none of the victims are West, the Flash continues his investigation, at the discotheques West researched on her last assignment. Inquires about the Satan Circle garner the Flash nothing but silence.</p><p>Outside of ""Hell On Earth"", the Flash is attacked by the motorcycle gang, Hell's Imps. Circling the Flash, the exhaust from the Hell's Imp's motorcycles momentarily incapacitate the Flash, allowing the gang to escape under cover of their own exhaust. At Pluto's Palace, the Flash meets a girl willing to lead him to the Satan Circle. The girl, Ora, leads the Flash to an old house, on the edge of a cemetery. Inside the house, the Flash comes face to face with the Satan Circle, just as they are about to sacrifice West.</p><p>The Flash attacks the Satan Circle, only to find himself suddenly suffering from the effects of a powerful hallucinogen. The hallucinogen was administered to the Flash through the Hell's Imp's exhaust. Tapping his fingers at super-speed against the floor, the Flash causes the floor to collapse, gaining some distance between himself, West and the Satan Circle. The Flash, carrying West in his arms, flees the house, only to be surrounded by the Satan Circle.</p><p>Vibrating at super-speed, the Flash is able to become immaterial enough for their gunfire to, harmlessly, pass through him. Their special ammunition, however, detonates as it enters the Flash's vibratory field. The Hell's Imp's close on the Flash. Caught between a rock and a hard place, the Flash whirls around the Satan Circle, and casts them violently into the Hell's Imps. With the case wrapped up, the Flash and West return to Central City.</p><h3>The Accusation!</h3><p>In a dream, Mister Carson is accused of murdering Walter Savin, by Kid Flash. Carson awakens, noticeably shaken. The next night, Carson again is accused by Kid Flash, this time citing that the murder was motivated by a jewelry theft.

When the Flash marvels at the beauty of the Earth, as seen from orbit, Superman ruins the moment by stressing his alienness. To the Man Of Steel's surprise, the Flash empathizes. The Flash then recites a recent adventure. As police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, the Flash had received a frantic call from his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, urging him to come home. Upon arrival, Allen could find no signs of West, but evidence pointed towards a hurried departure. A note, left by West, informed Allen that she had been taken 1000 years into the future.</p><p>Allen, as the Flash, used his Cosmic Treadmill to journey to the year 2970. The Flash found the Central City of the future to be a sprawling desert, traversed by a polymer tube encased river. Vibrating his finger at super-human speed, the Flash penetrated the tube, to slake his thirst. Almost immediately after, he is fired upon, with exploding shells, for stealing water. Vibrating so fast as to become intangible, the Flash allowed the shells to harmlessly pass through his body, then ran the length of the river, straight through a mountain. On the other side of the mountain, the Flash found what was left of civilization, a self-contained city, but one that bore the tell tale signs of atomic bombardment.</p><p>Moving faster than the eye could see, the Flash entered the city, accidentally jostling one of the citizens into spilling his water rations. Mistakenly, the man lashed out at another citizen, blaming him for the mishap. The two men were about to come to blows, when an air-raid siren blared out. The streets quickly emptied, as everyone ran for shelter. It was at this moment that the Flash encountered West. Their reunion was not a happy one, as West demanded the Flash return to his proper era... without her. After the Flash, as Allen, had left for work, West went to her father's house, to clean up his basement laboratory. There, West discovered a, heretofore, unseen baby picture of herself, wearing a locket.</p><p>West then found the locket, which was engraved ""Iris Russell"". The moment West touched the locket, a pre-recorded message was triggered. A scientist, Eric Russel, from the year 2945, spoke of an imminent nuclear attack, coming from a province called ""Earth-East"". Russel, his wife, Fran, and their daughter, Iris, were inhabitants of the city structure, ""Earth-West"". To save their daughter, the Russells sent their daughter back 1000 years, into the past. West's father, Professor Ira West, confirmed the story. The Wests raised Iris as their own daughter. The truth of her origins revealed to her, the time vibrations that stabilized West's presence in the past began to break down.</p><p>Ultimately, West was drawn back to her proper era, in the future. There, West was reunited with her true parents, who both survived the nuclear attack. Their reunion, though, was short lived, as West is soon coveted, as a mate, by the supreme leader of Earth-East, Sirik. With the destruction of Earth-West threatened, West gave herself up to Sirik. The Flash, though, refused to capitulate to Sirik. The supreme leader sent his guards after the Flash, who ran from them at normal human speed. Once the Flash had lured them in, he fought back with the full gamut of his super-speed abilities. After defeating the guards, the Flash then returned to confront Sirik.</p><p>The Flash mercilessly beat Sirik until he conceded defeat. Sirik informed the Flash that, having failed to report in to Earth-East at a prearranged time, Earth-East had fired it's missiles on Earth-West. Generating powerful whirlwinds, at super-human speed, the Flash prematurely detonated the missiles, then destroyed the launch sites. The Flash convinced the contentious sides to live in harmony, for the sake of the continuation of the human race. The Russells give their blessing for West to continue living her life in the 20th Century, with her husband. At which point, the Flash and West returned home.</p><p>His tale finished, the Flash points out that he shares Superman's feelings of alienation, whenever he visits his wife's family in the 30th Century. Superman counters by noting that the Flash has West to share his life with, while Superman has no one, and thus will feel forever alone.</p>",,,,,,,False,11254,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/10220-1995-11254-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",203,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55849/', 'id': 55849, 'name': 'Justice League Satellite', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/justice-league-satellite/4020-55849/'}]",The Flash's Wife Is A Two-Timer!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1768/', 'id': 1768, 'name': 'Neal Adams', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neal-adams/4040-1768/', 'role': 'artist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43530/', 'id': 43530, 'name': 'Robert Kanigher', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/robert-kanigher/4040-43530/', 'role': 'writer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-203-the-flash-s-wife-is-a-two-timer/4000-11254/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Logan and Kandel survive, but Logan's son, Timmy, and Kandel's wife, Sylvia, are killed on impact. Logan and Kandel barter their own lives to bring their loved ones back from the dead. As fate would have it, their pleas are heard by a pair of aliens, Duus and Unuus. The aliens restore Timmy and Sylvia to life, while also granting Logan and Kandel immortality for the next 24 hours. At the end of which time, Kandel and Logan are to sacrifice their lives to the aliens. The aliens also restore Kandel's car, and Logan's plane, so that each may complete one final task.</p><p>Kandel races off to perform an urgent surgery, on a fellow doctor who may have discovered a cure for cancer. En route, Kandel comes up behind a running gun battle between police and a group of escaped convicts. Kandel takes two bullets in the chest, before the Flash can subdue the prisoners. True to the aliens' word, however, Kandel is unharmed. Explaining the situation to the Flash, Kandel is raced to the operating room by the Flash, who volunteers to scrub in on the surgery. With the Flash operating at super-human speed, Kandel is able to finish the surgery in record time, allowing him to spend that much more time with his wife, as the hours of the day wind down.</p><p>The Flash races off to assist with putting out a forest fire. As fate would have it, the Flash encounters Logan, who happens to be flying over the fire, on her way to compete at Alpine Meadows. After helping to propel Logan's plane away from powerful down-drafts, created by the fire, the Flash escorts Logan to Alpine Meadows. Logan is competing for a prize of $50,000.00 dollars, to put towards her son's college education. Her primary competitor in the aerial stunt competition is the greater experienced Mal Maynton. Logan finds Maynton matching her move for move. When Maynton dives from the plane into a dead drop to the ground, Logan knows she's all but beaten.</p><p>Counting on the alien's gift of immortality, Logan leaps from the plane's wing, too. Unlike, Maynton, Logan never pulls the rip cord on her parachute, landing on her own two feet on the ground, completely unharmed. Logan wins the competition. Refusing to allow two such gifted individuals to sacrifice their lives to the whims of aliens, the Flash puts himself between the aliens and their intended victims. After surviving three attempts, by the aliens, to murder the Flash, the aliens relent, allowing Logan and Kandel to live out their normal lifespan.</p><h3>""Showdown In Elongated Town!""</h3><p>The Elongated Man awakens, as if from a trance, to find himself hauling a buckboard through an Old West ghost town. Taking in his surroundings, the Elongated Man finds that all the structures are weirdly distorted, as if being seen through a funhouse mirror. The Elongated Man is called out by an equally distorted gunslinger, one whose weapon fires beams of reflected sunlight. In dodging the laser, the Elongated Man slams his head into a building outcropping.</p><p>By the time he recovers, and captures the gunfighter, the man has been replaced by a dummy. Strangely, the dummy does not appear distorted, as the gunfighter had. Suddenly, the Elongated Man is beset by a herd of stampeding animals. As he turns to run from them, the Elongated Man finds himself facing an enormous rattlesnake. Stretching himself upwards, the Elongated Man winds himself around a flagpole. Hearing the sounds of the stampede, and the rattlesnake, coming from speakers, the Elongated Man realizes they are naught but illusions.</p><p>Stretching out his eyeballs, the Elongated Man removes a pair of contact lens from them, restoring his sight to normal. Taking up a rifle, the Elongated Man steps back out into the street, knowing full well who his true foe is... the Mirror Master. As the Mirror Master closes and draws on the Elongated Man, the Stretchable Sleuth squeezes himself down the barrel of the rifle. Once the Mirror Master has come in close enough, the Elongated Man springs out of the barrel of the gun, slamming into the Mirror Master, rendering him unconscious.</p><p> </p>",,,,,,,False,11408,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/10363-1995-11408-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",206,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",24 Hours Of Immortality!; Showdown In Elongated Town!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58436/', 'id': 58436, 'name': 'Mirror Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-gun/4055-58436/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1768/', 'id': 1768, 'name': 'Neal Adams', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neal-adams/4040-1768/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43530/', 'id': 43530, 'name': 'Robert Kanigher', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/robert-kanigher/4040-43530/', 'role': 'writer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-206-24-hours-of-immortality-showdown-in-/4000-11408/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Wally West acts quickly to keep the students from panicking. That night, West is attending a peace rally, with his girlfriend, Dana, when the same phenomena begins to occur again. West investigates, as Kid Flash. Moving faster than the eye can see, Kid Flash spies a fellow speedster moving through the crowded rally. Kid Flash moves in to apprehend the mysterious racing figure, only to be forcibly repelled.</p><p>Following a trail of litter, Kid Flash tracks the rival speedster to a series of hills. There he finds his quarry, passed out, clearly suffering from malnutrition. The speedster, while humanoid, is clearly not human. Kid Flash clears away the rocks and debris from a recent landslide, and discovers a hidden cave. The speedster rushes in, and disappears.

Also, when Kid Flash traces a mysterious explosion to another dimension, he finds that it was caused by the K-10 gang.</em></p><h3>A Kind Of Miracle In Central City</h3><p>A group of teenagers deliver stolen goods to the ""Chief"", at a church in Central City. A group of nuns enter the church, and demand to take possession of the stolen goods. The Chief ignores the nuns, and departs with the stolen goods. With the nuns guarding the church, the Chief chooses a rooftop for the next drop. Suspicious of one of the teens, due to the boy's connection to one of the nuns, the Chief throws the boy off the roof. Fortunately, for the teen, the Flash happens to be racing by at that exact moment, and saves the boy's life.</p><p>Adhering to the ""Code Of The Streets"", the boy refuses to tell the Flash anything. Realizing he spends most of his time handling the ""big threats"", the Flash determines that helping this boy is just as, if not more, important. Running faster than the eye can see, the Flash follows the boy back to the church, and learns of the Chief's racket. Searching Central City in ever widening circles, the Flash locates the Cheif's hideaway, and the stolen goods.</p><p>Still moving invisibly, the Flash carries the teen, and his girlfriend, in his slipstream, to the Chief's lair. The Chief, and his two henchmen, ""Blue"" and ""Grey"", attempt to murder the two teens, but the Flash, still invisible, thwarts them at every turn. The Flash adds his velocity to the teenager's punch, allowing him to knock out all three crooks with a single blow. The teens turn the stolen goods over to the authorities. With a good word from the church, the teen is released into the custody of the nuns.</p><h3>Malice In Wonderland</h3><p>Ralph Dibny happens to be passing through the town of Dodgson, during it's 50th anniversary celebration. Dibny is handed a copy of <ins>Alice In Wonderland</ins>, then finds a shady spot from which to read it. Dibny's solitude is broken by the character of the White Rabbit, loudly proclaiming his tardiness, as he gets into a city cab. His suspicion roused, Dibny pursues the White Rabbit, as the Elongated Man. The Elongated Man has just about caught up with the cab, when he trips over a Mad Hatter.</p><p>The Elongated Man learns that the town of Dodgson was founded by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, the author of <ins>Alice in Wonderland</ins>. In celebration, the town's population is costumed in the garb of the book's characters, as originally illustrated by Sir John Tenniel. Learning that a rare first edition copy of<ins> Alice In Wonderland</ins> is on display at the civic city, the Elongated Man determines that the White Rabbit will strike there. The White Rabbit, along with the Knave of Hearts, gas the Elongated Man, and steal the book.</p><p>Acting on a clue garnered from a scrap of paper taken off the White Rabbit, along with a tip from the Mad Hatter, the Elongated Man makes his way to the Wonderland Parade. The Elongated Man spies the White Rabbit on the mushroom float, and snatches the book away from the White Rabbit. A brief struggle ensues. Ultimately, the Elongated Man triumphs over his foes. After turning the thieves over to the authorities, the Elongated Man reveals that it was the White Rabbit's costume, taken from the movie as opposed to the book, which first made him suspicious of him.</p><h3>The Flash's Sensational Risk!</h3><p>This story was originally published in <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/the-flash-149-the-flash-s-sensational-risk/4000-7455/"" data-ref-id=""4000-7455"">The Flash #149</a> (December, 1964).

Weapons at the ready, the Trickster discovers that the Flash is already dead. Moments prior, the Flash had received a mental image of Captain Boomerang and the Trickster's whereabouts. As the Flash closed in on them, the villains also received a mental image of the Flash's route.With a rope stretched taut between them, the Rogues tripped the Flash, causing him to violently skid to a stop, face down on the ground.</p><p>What the Rogues could not see was that the Flash was caught up in the slipstream of an object moving even faster than him. So fast is the object moving, that the Flash exceeds the speed of life, and breaks through the life barrier. The object turns out to be a kind of guardian, tasked with patrolling the outer edges of the life barrier. A horrific creature, known only as the ""Devourer"", is consuming it's way into the Flash's universe. The Sentry has carried the Flash into the life dimension, to aid in the struggle against the Devourer.</p><p>Back on earth, Captain Boomerang keeps the Trickster from unmasking the Flash's lifeless body. The two Rogues begin arguing over who is truly responsible for murdering the Flash. Their debate is interrupted by the Super-Gorilla, Grodd. It was Grodd who projected the mental images that brought about the Flash's confrontation with Captain Boomerang and the Trickster. Grodd had planned for the Rogues to do his dirty work for him. All the risks would be on them. Captain Boomerang and the Trickster attack Grodd.</p><p>The Rogues prove to be no match for the Super-Gorilla. The Flash perceives the Devourer in different fashions, first seeing it as an enormous rat, then a flame-thrower. A giant ram then a Tyrannosaur. Once the Flash finally hits upon the correct super-speed motions to defeat the Devourer, the creature takes on the appearance of the Flash's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West. From the Flash's point of view, it seems as if he's killing his wife, but the Devourer's last ditch psychological tactic fails.</p><p>The Flash doesn't falter in his efforts to destroy the Devourer. The Sentry returns the Flash's astral self back to the mortal realm, where it is reunited with his body. The Flash revives just as Grodd is psychically forcing Captain Boomerang and the Trickster to turn their weapons on one another. Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flash drives Grodd into the ground, then mericilessly beats him into unconsciousness. Captain Boomerang and the Trickster surrender peacefully.</p><h3><ins>Coincidence Can Kill!</ins></h3><p>Wally West stumbles across a bank robbery in progress. West activates the hidden spring that releases his KId Flash costume from his ring. Instead of his costume, though, the ring releases anesthetic gas, that knocks West out. Upon recovery, West realizes that he accidentally swapped rings with his laboratory partner, George, when they were in the wash room. Wearing a spare costume, West, as Kid Flash, gets on George's trail. As George's ambition has always been to take down a big fish in the criminal underworld, George has arranged to meet with a syndicate leader.</p><p>George activates the gas projector in ""his"" ring, only to see Kid Flash's costume spring out. The criminals, believing George to be Kid Flash, level their guns at him. Kid Flash disarms the crooks, then beats them all into unconsciousness. To protect his secret identity, Kid Flash allows George to believe that the gas in his ring slowly seeped out, and that Kid Flash threw the other costume into the room as a distraction.</p><h3><ins>The Elongated Man's Undersea Trap!</ins></h3><p>This story was originally published in <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/the-flash-119-the-mirror-master-s-magic-bullet-the/4000-134356/"" data-ref-id=""4000-134356"" data-mce-href=""//www.comicvine.com/the-flash-119-the-mirror-master-s-magic-bullet-the/4000-134356/"">The Flash #119</a> (March, 1961).

To Allen's horror, he sees West competing in the roller derby. West is brutally throw over the rail by ""Kolossal""Kate Krasher, the roller derby's newest sensation. Moments before West loses consciousness, she sees a horrific vision of Krasher, who appears alien and monstrous. West confides in Allen what she saw, but Allen brushes away West's concerns as a nightmare. As Allen leaves work, the next night, Central City's business district is struck by an earthquake.</p><p>Allen goes into action, as the Flash. One minute after the earthquake has struck, the Flash has saved countless lives. At the Science Institute, the Flash learns that the epicenter of the earthquake is directly underneath the Roller Derby Stadium. Poking around the stadium, after hours, the Flash notices that the roller skates are all giving off a feint glow of radiation. A closer look reveals alien machinery inside the skates. Krasher clubs the Flash from behind. Moments before the Flash loses consciousness, he, too, sees Krasher as an alien horror.</p><p>The Flash awakens, suspended over the stadium floor, bound tightly in what Krasher refers to as a ""Strangling Sheath"". Krasher confirms that she is, in fact, an alien creature, sent to Earth to destroy it. Krasher's race intends to manufacture a new world to live upon, out of the raw material of the Earth. To that end, Krasher has built a massive Energi-Coil, beneath the roller derby stadium, that stretches down into the Earth's core. Unbeknownst to the other roller derby competitors, the skates they wear are really power chargers, designed to activate the coil, with every revolution around the rink.</p><p>Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flash breaks free from the Strangling Sheath. Strapping on a pair of skates, the Flash begins racing counter-clockwise to Krasher, in the hopes of shutting down the Energi-Coil. Suddenly, Krasher reverses direction, and grabs ahold of the Flash as he races past her. When the Energi-Coil fully activates, the Flash realizes Krasher has tricked him. Throwing ten pairs of ""skates"" on the rink, the Flash keeps them all moving at super-human speed, in the opposite direction, to shut down the Energi-Coil. Krasher lunges for the the Flash, but trips over the speeding skates. With the Earth saved, the Flash turns Krasher over to the authorities.</p><h3><ins>""The Rival Flash!""</ins></h3><p>This story was originally published in<a href=""//www.comicvine.com/flash-comics-104-the-flaming-darkness-the-rival-fl/4000-161531/"" data-ref-id=""4000-161531""> Flash Comics #104</a> (February, 1949).

Barton punches Allen in the nose, rides him like a horse, ropes a newspaper to his face, and shoots him, repeatedly, with a pellet gun. Finally, Allen gets Barton to settle down and watch cartoons. Allen is stunned to hear the voice of his nemesis, Abra Kadabra, coming from his television set. Impossibly, Abra Kadabra has taken over the cartoon world.

Not wanting to leave Barton alone, the Flash drags the boy into the television with him.</p><p>Barton has fun playing with the ""Purple Pixies"". The Flash is attacked by two of the pixies, wearing capes like Abra Kadabra, and wielding shock wands. The pixies are able to match the Flash's super-speed, all the while delivering shocks to his system, as he tries to flee. Vibrating at super speed, the Flash becomes immaterial, allowing the shocks to pass harmlessly through him. Suddenly, Abra Kadabra appears, and begins hurling control rods into the Flash. Made up of a rare 64th Century element, the control rods take away the Flash's ability to vibrate his molecules, rendering him solid once more.</p><p>To buy some time, the Flash plays to Abra Kadabra's monstrous ego by applauding his latest scheme. Abra Kadabra reveals how he used 64th Century technology to create the cartoonworld, which is set to self-destruct, in less than half an hour. Vibrating air molecules in front of him, the Flash drives off the Purple Pixies, to get Barton's attention. The Flash dupes Barton into firing at him with his pellet gun. The laws of physics, however, don't apply in Abra Kadabra's cartoonworld. All of Barton's shots miss the Flash in exceedingly comical fashion.</p><p>Luckily, Barton's first pellet, which has been bouncing around on the ground by the Flash's feet, strikes the Scarlet Speedster. The impact jumpstarts his molecular control, allowing him to vibrate loose from Abra Kadabra's control rods. With Barton carried along in his slipstream, the Flash races for Abra Kadabra's escape vehicle. Upon returning to Central City, the Flash reflects Abra Kadabra's weapon back on him, transforming the 64th Century ""magician"" into a cardboard cutout. Barton is returned to the Allen residence, where he is picked up by his mother.</p><h3><ins>""When Money Grows On Trees!</ins></h3><p>Sue Dibny gives a young boy, Timmy Dennison, a dollar for change. Dennison buries the dollar in the ground, takes a pull from a canteen, and chants an incantation. Miraculously, a money tree grows from where Dennison planted the dollar bill. Dibny's husband, Ralph, decides to investigate this impossible act, as the Elongated Man. The Stretchable Sleuth drives Dennison home to his father, billionaire Victor Dennison. After passing through an extensive security check, the Elongated Man is ushered in to meet Dennison's father. The elder Dennison offers to place the money from the tree in the bank. The young Dennison breaks down crying.</p><p>The Elongated Man points out to the elder Dennison that his son wants attention, not a back account. Dennison has the Elongated Man escorted off the premises. Analyzing some of the bills from the money tree, the Elongated Man learns that the elder Dennison's life is in jeopardy. With security ordered to keep him out, the Elongated Man must surreptitiously enter Dennison's estate. After gaining entry and weaving his way through a laser grid, the Elongated Man finds himself in combat with Dennison's security forces.  Dennison fires on the Elongated Man twice, then collapses. Dennison's corpse is wheeled out of his estate.</p><p>To the astonishment of the gathered crowd, Dennison miraculously recovers. One of the onlookers rails at Dennison, giving himself away as Dennison's would-be murderer, just as the Elongated Man planned. After subduing the man, the Elongated Man reveals that the money tree is an old magician's trick. The money on it's branches was coated with a contact poison. Timmy Dennison was given the antidote to the poison, in the canteen from which he drank from, so that he would not be poisoned. After the elder Dennison collapsed, the Elongated Man administered the antidote, and set up the ruse to flush out the killer. The elder Dennsion, at last, realizes the value of his son.</p><h3><ins>Snare Of The Headline Huntress!</ins></h3><p>This story was originally published in <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/the-flash-126-doom-of-the-mirror-flash/4000-5736/"" data-ref-id=""4000-5736"">The Flash #126</a> (February, 1962).

Allen is at a loss to explain how he came to be in the Garricks' home. Worse, the Golden Age Flash seems to be missing. Allen dons the Golden Age Flash's costume, and accepts an award in his stead. The ceremony is interrupted, when Allen spies an old man, ""Dalvan"", about to be run down by a tractor trailer. Allen rescues ""Dalvan"", only to learn that  ""Dalvan"" purposefully placed his own life in jeopardy, to get close enough to speak to Allen.</p><p>Furthermore,""Dalvan"" knows that Allen is not the Golden Age Flash. Allen accompanies""Dalvan"" to his home. There, ""Dalvan"" reveals the Golden Age Flash's whereabouts. By Occult means, ""Dalvan"" opens a portal into limbo, so that Allen can retrieve the Golden Age Flash. Incredibly, ""Dalvan"" also produces Allen's actual Flash costume, for him to don. Swiftly locating his counterpart, Allen, as the Silver Age Flash revives the Golden Age Flash. The Golden Age Flash reveals that he was drawn into limbo to retrieve a meteor. Failing to do so will result in the destruction of Earth-2.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the Golden Age Flash, he has actually been compelled to retrieve the meteor that bestowed immortality on his arch-enemy, Vandal Savage. After living for centuries, time has finally caught up with Vandal Savage. Without a second exposure to the meteor's radiation, he will die. The Scarlet Speedsters catch up with the meteor, and trap it in their slipstream. The meteor is hurled out of limbo, and back into reality. When the Scarlet Speedsters attempt to follow it, though, they slam headlong into an invisible barrier.</p><p>Unconscious, they drift silently through the void, until they are found by Tempus, the Guardian Of The Time Stream. Unfortunately for the Scarlet Speedsters, Tempus refuses to allow them to leave. The Scarlet Speedsters battle against Tempus for their freedom. Upon their triumph, Tempus allows them to depart. Racing through the time stream, the Scarlet Speedsters begin to rapidly age. Only by running backwards are they able to reverse their accelerated aging. After navigating their way past a whirlpool, and a waterfall, in time, the Scarlet Speedsters finally make their way back to Earth-2.</p><p>Along the way, they discover that they have both been duped by ""Dalvan"", who is revealed to be Vandal Savage. The Scarlet Speedsters find Vandal Savage anxiously awaiting the arrival of his meteor. To prevent the Scarlet Speedsters from interfering, Vandal Savage imprisons them beneath a steel-mesh net. Vandal Savage suddenly realizes that he is in peril, when the meteor fails to slow it's descent, crashing into him with explosive force.

Desmond pulls a gun on himself, and transmutes his clothing into the costume of his villainous alter-ego, Mr. Element. After setting the Flash afire, Mr. Element flees. After two attempts to smother the fire fail, the Flash races out to, then dives into, a lake. Still the fire rages around him. Realizing that it is his costume that is burning, and not himself, the Flash doffs his uniform, then runs home, naked, faster than the eye can see. Reporting for work, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is accosted by Rita Desmond.</p><p>Rita reveals the true nature of her husband's dual personality. Desmond's father, astronomer Peter Desmond, had discovered a pulsating star in the ""eye"" of the Dragon Constellation. The pulsating solar rays of the star were focused through Desmond's telescope, into his ring. While holding his infant son, the pulsating energy erupted from Desmond's ring, bathing his newborn son in it's unstable radiation. With each pulsation of the ""Dragon's Eye"", Desmond's evil persona of Mister Element was brought to the surface. Allen takes possession of the ring for further study.</p><p>In a jealous rage, Mr. Element accosts Allen on the street. Allen flees, escaping Mr. Element just long enough to switch into his Flash costume. The Flash tackles Mr. Element from behind, then takes possession of Mr. Element's gun. The Element-Gun, though, will not work for the Flash. Mr. Element reveals that the power is actually his, the gun merely focuses his elemental energies. To prove it, Mr. Element transmutes the Flash into neon gas, then traps him inside a neon sign. Exercising his complete control of the atoms of his own body, the Flash is able to resume a human shape, albeit one composed of neon gas.</p><p>Suddenly, the Flash is returned to normal. In a moment of clarity, Desmond's psyche has become momentarily dominant. Desmond begs the Flash to kill him, before he destroys the world. Desmond reveals that the ""Dragon's Eye"" has gone super-nova. When the power of it's dying rays reach him, it will cause his elemental energies to explode, taking the planet with him. The Flash races around the planet, faster and faster, until he reaches escape velocity, and slingshots off the Earth. With a cone of air clinging to him, the Flash ejects thousands of atoms per second, from his own body, giving him enough propulsion to continue accelerating.</p><p>After the Flash has broken through the negative light barrier, he collects the negative starlight in Desmond's ring. Returning to Earth, the Flash confronts Mr. Element. Bombarding Mr. Element in negative starlight, the Flash is able to cancel out the effects of the positive starlight of the exploding ""Dragon's Eye"". With Desmond finally free of the ""curse"" of the ""Dragon's Eye"", the Flash returns Desmond's father's ring to him.</p><h3><ins>""2D?""</ins></h3><p>Wally West picks up a hitchhiker, Hildy, en route to his college interview at Valley State College. Upon arrival, West finds the campus deserted. Responding to Hildy's screams, West investigates, as Kid Flash. The Fastest Boy On Earth discovers monstrous alien creatures carrying Hildy to the college's art center. Kid Flash attacks the creatures, and rescues Hildy. After searching the art center, Kid Flash can find no trace of the creatures.</p><p>Upon discovery of a large canvas depicting an alien vista, Kid Flash plays a hunch, and ""falls asleep"" before the canvas. Astonishingly, one of the alien horrors emerges from the canvas to collect Kid Flash's ""unconscious"" form. Kid Flash discovers the faculty of Valley State College working in an alien mine. Kid Flash takes out the alien monstrosities  by generating miniature tornadoes at super-human speed.</p><p>When one of the instructors reveals that they were unable to return from the alien side of the painting, Kid Flash realizes that the headbands the aliens wear allow them to traverse the dimensional interface, through the painting, to Earth. After leading the faculty home, Kid Flash sees to it that the painting is destroyed.</p><h3><ins>""Anything Can Happen!""</ins></h3><p>This story was originally published in <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/all-flash-quarterly-30/4000-151489/"" data-ref-id=""4000-151489"">All-Flash Quarterly #30</a> (August-September, 1947).

By the time the Flash has ushered all the innocent bystanders to safety, the Dreadnaught has vanished. While the Flash sets about to, single-handedly, rebuilding a demolished office building, he is observed by Professor Ira West. Awed by the Flash's super-speed prowess, West decides to try to figure out how the Flash does it. West inputs all the data he knows about the Flash into his newest invention, the Functional Recorder of Encyclopedic Data, or F.R.E.D., for short. F.R.E.D. determines that no human being could ever be capable of possessing the super-human speed of the Flash.</p><p>Therefore, the Flash is a fraud, perpetrated by five men, all dressed in Flash costumes, stationed at different points throughout the city. Astonished, West races to tell his daughter, Picture News reporter, Iris West. After West has departed, F.R.E.D. realizes it has made a miscalculation, and that it is wrong about the Flash. Fearing that West will destroy it for it's error, F.R.E.D. uses all the power at it's disposal to make it's calculation true. Suddenly, while racing through the streets of Central City, the Flash becomes five men. The five Flashes immediately begin arguing over which of them is the real Flash. Racing home, the five Flashes make contact with their wife, Iris.</p><p>Iris recounts her father's wild theory about the Flash being five men. En route to West's laboratory, the Flashes re-encounter the Dreadnaught. Their numbers prove to be a disadvantage as the Flashes keep getting in each other's way. The Dreadnaught escapes without a trace again, inexplicably eluding all five Flashes. To prevent the Flash from reaching West, and revealing what it's done, F.R.E.D. enhances the Flashs' aggressiveness towards one another. Four of the Flashs begin brawling, revealing that the fifth Flash is the real Flash. The Flash realizes that the other four Flashes are just solidified super-speed after-images of him, albeit with the power to think.</p><p>The Flash matches his speed and vibratory rate to his copies, and reabsorbs them. In a last desperate attempt to keep the Flash away, F.R.E.D. compels the Dreadnaught to reveal itself from it's hiding place, within a tractor trailer. The Flash dismantles the Dreadnaught, then ushers it's pilots to the nearest police precinct. Finally reaching West's laboratory, The Flash finds West putting out a fire, while shutting F.R.E.D. down. F.R.E.D. has suffered a major power overload, which for all intents and purposes, greatly resembles a human nervous breakdown.</p><h3>The Killing of an Archer!</h3><p>The Green Arrow keeps a rendezvous with a criminal gang. Entering a dark alley, the Green Arrow confronts the gang's leader. At the man's command, the alley is flooded with bright light. Blinded, the Green Arrow fights a desperate battle against the man, and his minions. The Green Arrow manages to shoot out the flood light, only to come under fire from a sniper. The Green Arrow returns fire, but a twinge in his injured arm causes him to miss his shot, accidentally killing his opponent. The Green Arrow is horrified at having taken a life.</p><p>Not long after the unfortunate incident, former test pilot, Hal Jordan, receives a frantic call from florist, Dinah Drake Lance. In response to Lance's concerns about the Green Arrow, Jordan investigates, as the Green Lantern. Arriving at the Green Arrow's apartment, the Green Lantern discovers the Green Arrow's bow broken, his arrows ruined, and his costume in tatters. Before he can investigate further, the Green Lantern is drawn into a conflict, occurring on the street outside.</p><p>Three youths are beating an old man. The Green Lantern puts an end to the conflict, then ushers all partries back towards the Green Arrow's apartment building. The three youths protest going back inside, as they have just planted a bomb, set to go off at any moment. As if on cue, the bomb detonates, destroying the Green Arrow's apartment building. Payback for his murder of the sniper.</p>",,,,,,,False,12385,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4109520-%24%28kgrhqzhje8fg498fofmbruq3seeeq~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",217,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-47879/', 'id': 47879, 'name': 'Coast City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coast-city/4020-47879/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-47878/', 'id': 47878, 'name': 'Star City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/star-city/4020-47878/'}]",The Flash Times Five is Fatal!;

The Allens momentarily come to a stop, to allow a parade of Scottish bagpipers to pass. Moments later, a news bulletin comes over the radio, concerning a robbery being committed by a Scottish bagpiper. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Arriving on the scene, the Flash sees the Scotsman walking away from the bank, while the security guards dance to the music of his bagpipes. Quickly, the Flash reveals the Scotsman to be his arch-nemesis, the Pied Piper.</p><p>Playing a few notes on a hidden, miniature reed, the Pied Piper activates his newest musical weapon, the Psychic-Pipe. Under it's influence, the Flash's reaction time falls out of sync with his movements, causing him to trip over his own feet. With the Flash momentarily incapacitated, the Pied Piper escapes. Unbeknownst to the Pied Piper, the Psychic-Pipe has a greater effect on the Flash than just dulling his reaction time. The Flash also suffers a mental block that prevents him from removing his mask, as well as erasing all memory of who he is.</p><p>Suddenly, West races by, clearly no longer in control of the malfunctioning X-5. The Flash rescues her, but has no recollection of his relationship to her. The Flash spends the day at police headquarters, desperately trying to learn his real name. Realizing the Pied Piper must be causing this effect with a sonic weapon, the Flash attunes his vibratory frequency to match it, until he can see the waves emanating across the city. In this way, the Flash is able to track the sound waves back to the Psychic-Pipe's precise location. The Flash sets about dismantling the device.</p><p>Anticipating this action, the Pied Piper has booby-trapped the Psychic-Pipe. As soon as the Flash tampers with it, the Psychic Pipe explodes. With his foe defeated, the Pied Piper unmasks the Flash. To his astonishment, the Flash's face is vibrating so fast his features cannot be determined. Suddenly, the Flash leaps to his feet, and bombards the Pied Piper with debris from the Psychic-Pipe. After turning the Pied Piper over to the authorities, the Flash returns home for a reunion with the wife he now remembers.</p><h3>Green Arrow Is Dead!</h3><p>A bomb explodes in the basement of Oliver Queen's apartment building, retaliation for Queen's accidental slaying of a young sniper, as the Green Arrow. Investigating Queen's disappearance, the Green Lantern uses his power ring to create energy constructs, keeping the building from collapsing, until fire and rescue teams can arrive. Once they do, the Green Lantern collapses in exhaustion, just as the Black Canary arrives on the scene.</p><p>At that moment, Queen is flying the Arrowplane, his mind lost replaying the events of the sniper's death, at his hands. Queen pilots the Arrowplane into a mountainside, ejecting from the cockpit before impact. Queen wanders to a remote monastery, begging for help and forgiveness. After recharging his power ring, the Green Lantern resumes his search for Queen, first heading out to a rendezvous site with the Black Canary. The Black Canary, though, has momentarily abandoned the search for Queen.</p><p>Having come across a homegrown terrorist group, the Black Canary infiltrates their ranks. The Black Canary is discovered, and though she puts up a valiant fight, she is overcome by their greater numbers. The Black Canary is carried up to the rooftop, and thrown off. She is rescued by the Green Lantern, who also rounds up the terrorist group.

Dillon scoffs, but accepts the wager. True to his word, Scudder teleports out of their cell, via the mirror-like polish he's put on his shoes. Scudder, as the Mirror Master, sets about retrieving Dillon's million dollars, from a top-shaped satellite, in low Earth orbit. As the satellite is drawn to Earth, onlookers see the image of the Flash, tied to the satellite, burning up on re-entry. Among the crowd of bystanders is police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, who takes action, as the Flash.</p><p>Cracking open a fire hydrant, the Flash slows the satellite's descent with a high-speed, pressurized jet of water. As soon as the satellite touches down, it spins away, at high velocity, just like a top. The Flash runs it down, just as the Mirror Master arrives to collect it. The Flash dodges the Mirror Master's laser fire, then attacks, only to discover that the Mirror Master is merely a reflected illusion. With the Flash in pursuit, the Mirror Master ""flees"", leading the Flash back to the prison.</p><p>With a bit of trick flying,the Mirror Master maneuvers the Flash into his old cell, still occupied by Dillon. Having rigged the cell with mirror sensors, the Mirror Master informs the Flash that if he tries to vibrate back out, an atomic bomb will detonate, killing thousands of prison inmates. To add insult to injury, the Mirror Master offers Dillon his Top costume, so that he may die as his masked identity. Having no choice but to work together, the Flash, reluctantly, teams up with his arch-nemesis, the Top, to thwart the Mirror Master.</p><p>With the Top acting as a stabilizer, the Flash is able to vibrate out of the cell, without triggering the mirror sensors. The Flash catches up with the Mirror Master just as he is finishing looting the Top's satellite. Before he can react, the Mirror Master is quickly defeated, and returned to prison. A sullen Dillon vows revenge on both his nemesis, the Flash, and the man who betrayed him, the Mirror Master.</p><h3>The Fate Of An Archer</h3><p>While calling the Green Lantern from a pay phone, the Black Canary is run down by a drugged driver. The Green Lantern arrives in seconds, to find the Black Canary grievously injured. To make matters worse, the Black Canary's blood type is exceptionally rare, and hospitals are, currently, in short supply of it. Recharging his power ring, the Green Lantern sets off in search of the one man who can help the Black Canary... Oliver Queen. The Green Lantern discovers the wreckage of the Arrowplane, spread across a California mountain range. After dealing with a scavenger, Rink Willard, rummaging about in the wreckage, the Green Lantern tracks Queen to a secluded monastery.</p><p>Having accidentally slain a man, in his guise as the Green Arrow, Queen has come to the monastery is search of forgiveness, and to find a new way of life. The head of the monastery, though, impresses on Queen that his life as the Green Arrow has not yet come to an end. The Green Lantern arrives to collect Queen, informing him of the Black Canary's dire situation. Queen responds angrily to his forced return to ""civilization"", but, nonetheless, accompanies the Green Lantern. The head of the monastery passes on his own bow to Queen. As the Green Lantern and Queen exit the monastery, they are ambushed by Rink Willard.</p><p>Willard beats the Green Lantern unconscious with the butt of his rifle. Terrified of killing another man by accident, Queen freezes, allowing Willard to beat him down, without resistance. When Queen revives, he finds his hands tied. The Green Lantern, too, is bound, and slowly sinking into a quagmire.Though his ring has been neutralized, the Green Lantern is ever defiant in the face of death. Finding an arrowhead, Queen cuts his bonds, and makes a run for his bow. In one fluid motion, Queen grabs the bow and fires an arrow, through the sight on Willard's rifle, causing the gun to slam into Willard's face, rendering him unconscious. Back in Star City, the Black Canary is recovering thanks to Queen's transfusion of his blood.</p><h3> </h3>",,,,,,,False,12706,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/11436-1995-12706-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",219,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55716/', 'id': 55716, 'name': 'California', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/california/4020-55716/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-47878/', 'id': 47878, 'name': 'Star City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/star-city/4020-47878/'}]",The Million Dollar Deathtrap;

Kid Flash races to Central City, to consult with the Flash.  En route, he encounters an impossible tidal wave, jeopardizing the town of Bergville. Borrowing a shovel from a nearby hardware store, Kid Flash hastily erects a wall to dam the wave. Seconds after Kid Flash arrives at the Allen household, he vanishes, only to have the Flash suddenly reappear. A news bulletin reveals world wide catastrophes, occurring on account of the planet's accelerated rotation.</p><p>The Flash races to the arctic to slow down the encroachment of a glacier. Once more, the Flash disappears, leaving Kid Flash in his place. Finally realizing that their molecules were fused together, when they crashed into one another, the Scarlet Speedsters separate themselves. Returning to the site where they discovered the centrifugal booster, the Scarlet Speedsters quickly unearth it. Then, they destroy the device. Meanwhile, having regained his normal metabolism, the Turtle robs a bank. When the Scarlet Speedsters close on him, the Turtle protects himself by hiding within his shell. Racing around the Turtle, the Flash is surprised when the shell's aerodynamic design launches it into the air. The Flash hurls Kid Flash at the Turtle, bringing the villain down.</p><h3><ins>Duel For A Death-List!</ins></h3><p>Hal Jordan is en route to Arizona, in pursuit of a potential job prospect, when he spies the flash of an explosion. After charging his power ring, Jordan investigates, as the Green Lantern. At the site of an unfinished skyscraper, the Green Lantern discovers a dying alien. The alien passes the Green Lantern a list, before being gunned down. The Green Lantern engages the alien's murderer. Each time the Green Lantern lashes out with his power beam, the killer teleports away, while simultaneously blasting the Green Lantern. The Green Lantern places the murder victim in a protective force field, in Earth's orbit.</p><p>The Green Lantern then beams the skyscraper into orbit as well. Having eliminated the needed mass for the murderer's teleportation device to home in on, the killer is left with no means of transportation. The Green Lantern mercilessly beats the alien killer down with his bare hands. Defeated, the alien killer commits suicide. Having translated the list, Green Lantern is disturbed to discover that it is a list of five names, all marked for death. Four of the names have been crossed off. The remaining name on the list, is the Green Lantern's own.</p>",,,,,,,False,12885,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/11580-1995-12885-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",220,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55753/', 'id': 55753, 'name': 'Arizona', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/arizona/4020-55753/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-43692/', 'id': 43692, 'name': 'Phoenix', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/phoenix/4020-43692/'}]",The Slowest Man on Earth; Duel for a Death List,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40861/', 'id': 40861, 'name': ""Dennis O'Neil"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-oneil/4040-40861/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'artist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-220-the-slowest-man-on-earth-duel-for-a-/4000-12885/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

After another incident of his chronic tardiness, Allen sets out to prove he can maintain a proper schedule. After keeping his appointment at the bank, at exactly 11:30 a.m., Allen becomes aware that the very same bank was robbed, shortly after his departure. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Thanks to a new, cutting edge vault door, the robbers were thwarted in their attempt to rob the bank. Having lost time to investigate the attempted robbery, the Flash races to keep his next appointment on time. Recklessly racing at top speed through the streets of Central City, the Flash generates a powerful sonic boom that threatens to take out the bridge.</p><p>By racing in the opposite direction, the Flash counters the first sonic boom with a second. The Flash arrives for his appearance at the fairground, at precisely 12:15 p.m., only to find the circus animals stampeding. After hurriedly building cages around the lead elephants, the Flash digs out a deep trench to herd the rest of the stampeding animals together. Meanwhile, the would-be bank robbers, led by criminal mastermind, Cypher. set in motion a plan to get through the vault door. Arriving at precisely 1:00 p.m., the Flash makes his appearance at a charity benefit. For his performance, the Flash begins a routine featuring every tap dance and soft-shoe step ever recorded, all done in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the Flash, Cypher has rigged the platform the Flash is dancing on, to transfer his super-speed vibrations to a special gun. Using said gun, Cypher is able to channel the power of the Flash's super-speed vibrations into the vault door, destroying it. Unfortunately for Cypher, the Flash notices that the platform has been tampered with, and tracks the gang back to the bank. In virtually no time at all, the Flash has thwarted the robbery, and turned the bank robbers over to the authorities. The Flash, as Allen returns home, precisely at 2:00 p.m, winning his bet with his wife. West, anticipating Allen's arrival at least a half hour later, informs her husband that she had a surprise party planned for him, and she needs him to depart, and, upon his return, feign surprise.</p><h3><ins>Death-Threat On Titan!</ins></h3><p>Having discovered his name on an assassin's list, the Green Lantern consults with one of the Guardians Of The Universe on his next move. The Guardian reveals that the other victims were all Green Lanterns. Furthermore, their particular rings all contained ore mined on one of the moon's of Saturn, Titan. In orbit over Titan, the Green Lantern is attacked by an ancient Conn satellite. Overwhelmed and bound by the satellite, the Green Lantern is turned over to the alien assassin. Feigning unconsciousness, the Green Lantern waits until his bonds have been removed, to attack his would-be killers.</p><p>Though he fights valiantly, the Green Lantern is defeated. Upon awakening, the Green Lantern is told that the alien killers were exiled to Titan by the Guardians of the Universe, and forced to mine ore for the power rings. The aliens discovered that the unrefined ore could be used to neutralize both power rings, and power batteries. Having collected power rings from their previous victims, as well as the Green Lantern, the aliens intend to use the ore to drain the central power battery on Oa. Without the battery powering their life support systems, the Guardians of the Universe will die.</p><p>The Green Lantern manages to push enough of his will power into a piece of ore to blast through his bonds. With the element of surprise on his side, the Green Lantern defeats the alien killers. With his power ring back in his possession, the Green Lantern uses it to create a memorial to the whistle blower in the alien killers' organization, who tipped the Green Lantern off to their scheme.</p>",,,,,,,False,13068,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4107765-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21qufi%2Cvsbzydbson%28j%28v%28q~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",221,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41103/', 'id': 41103, 'name': 'Titan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/titan/4020-41103/'}]",Time-Schedule for Disaster!; Death-Threat on Titan!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40861/', 'id': 40861, 'name': ""Dennis O'Neil"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-oneil/4040-40861/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9755/', 'id': 9755, 'name': 'Nick Cardy', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nick-cardy/4040-9755/', 'role': 'cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-221-time-schedule-for-disaster-death-thr/4000-13068/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-9057/', 'id': 9057, 'name': 'Guardians of the Universe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

In Central City, the Flash responds to the strange phenomena of every car's exhaust, in the city, coalescing into a smog screen. The Flash discovers that the culprit is the Weather Wizard, who has created cover for a robbery.</p><p>The Flash quickly disperses the smog, only to be distracted by the sudden appearance of the Weather Wizard's spare costume. Taking advantage of the moment, the Weather Wizard shapes the smog into a snake, which begins choking and crushing the life out of the Flash. By the time the Flash has dispersed the ""smog snake"", the Weather Wizard has escaped. Sinestro makes contact with the fleeing Weather Wizard, and carries him away to safety. Upon recovery, the Green Lantern quickly determines that Sinestro is on Earth, and tracks him down to Central City. In exchange for creating an impenetrable cloud cover over the Earth, to conceal his actions from the Guardian's scrutiny, Sinestro offers to aid the Weather Wizard in killing the Flash.</p><p>In pursuit of the Weather Wizard, the Flash encounters a passenger helicopter in distress. Generating a super-speed powered updraft of air, the Flash gets the helicopter's rotor blades spinning again, only to see them completely fly off. The Green Lantern arrives, just in the nick of time, to make the save. Sinestro launches the Weather Wizard's atmos-diffuser into orbit. The device collects, and projects, a shield of cosmic dust around the Earth, blocking it from the Guardian's view. True to his word, Sinestro uses his ring to handicap the Flash. The Flash tracks down the Weather Wizard's hidden lair, a cabin in the woods. The second the Flash enters the cabin, the Weather Wizard destroys the cabin, with the force of a tornado.</p><p>Having vibrated himself into the ground at the last second, the Flash escapes unscathed. The Flash is just about to take down the Weather Wizard, when he is distracted by several trees suddenly launching themselves into the air. The Weather Wizard takes advantage of that moment, by transforming himself into a cloud, and fleeing. Coming across the flying trees, the Green Lantern uses his ring to convert them into sawdust. The Flash closes on the Weather Wizard, only to be frozen in his tracks. Vibrating his molecules at super-speed, the Flash thaws himself out. As he does so, a huge mountain suddenly springs up, jeopardizing a city bus. With some assistance from the Green Lantern, the Flash is able to get the bus to safety.</p><p>The Weather Wizard hits the Flash with a lightning bolt. The instant it hits, the mountain crumbles. The Green Lantern notices a disguised Sinestro among the bus passengers, and takes him out. The Flash escapes the collapse of the mountain, while also apprehending the Weather Wizard. The Green Lantern learns that Sinestro has connected the Flash's heart to the core of the Earth. Whenever the Flash's heart rate speeds up, from his super-speed running, catastrophic effects follow in his wake. Had the Weather Wizard succeeded in killing the Flash, the world would have been destroyed when the Flash' heart stopped. The Green Lantern severs the Flash's link to the planet, then removes the Weather Wizard's screen around the Earth.</p>",,,,,,,False,13342,"{'icon_url':

Three men step out of the car, and challenge the Flash to a race. All are under hypnosis, and state they will die if the Flash does not race them. At the library, the Flash learns the identity of each man. The race car driver, Don Blake, the speed boat captain, Frank Hobbs, and the test pilot, John Quint. Each man holds a speed record with his chosen conveyance. The Flash meets Blake on the salt flats outside Central City. Impossibly, Blake is able to keep pace with the Flash. Spying an old prospector, dying of thirst, the Flash breaks off from the race.</p><p>Using a cactus for a drill, the Flash brings up a fountain from an underground spring. Rejoining the race, a mere second later, the Flash is beaten when Blake suddenly blows past him. Blake vanishes in a burst of light.  The Flash meets Hobbs out in the Pacific Ocean. Equally impossibly, Hobbs, too is able to keep pace with the Flash. When their combined wake disrupts the launch of a polaris missile, the Flash breaks from the race to correct the missile's course. Resuming the race almost to the second he diverted, the Flash is amazed when he is beaten again. Hobbs, too, disappears in a burst of light.</p><p>Joining Quint, high in the sky, the Flash runs along ice crystals in the clouds to keep pace with Quint. Incredibly, Quint pulls ahead, capturing the Flash in his jet's slipstream. Quint puts his jet into a nosedive, pulling up at the last second, to hurl the Flash into the ground. The Flash vibrates his molecules to incorporeality, so that he passes harmlessly through the ground.  Quint disappears in a burst of light, only to reappear, in a deserted concrete bunker, as Doctor Light. Doctor Light has been the Flash's true opponent in each of the three races.</p><p>Each of Doctor Light's vehicles were equipped with technology to absorb the Flash's super-speed, allowing Doctor Light to surge ahead in each race. In effect, the Flash was running against his own super-speed. Having collected the Flash's super-speed energy, Doctor Light charges up the entire structure of the bunker, and waits for the Flash to arrive. The Flash races around the bunker, until the pressurized force he's created, destroys the bunker, thwarting Doctor Light's plan to slay the Justice League of America. Unbeknownst to Doctor Light, the Flash outraced Doctor Light back to his bunker, after the final race, and learned of Doctor Light's scheme, and how best to thwart it.</p><h3><ins>""Doomsday...

The Green Lantern returns to police headquarters, to find the bank robber has been released on bail.</p><p>Tracking the bank robber down, the Green Lantern confirms that the robber is in league with the banker. The satchel never had any money in it. The banker intended to file an insurance claim for the stolen money, then pocket the actual ""stolen"" funds. After turning the two men over to the authorities, the Green Lantern explains that his power beam couldn't have destroyed the money, as the inner lining of the satchel was bright yellow, the one color his ring is powerless against.</p><h3> </h3>",,,,,,,False,13754,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4107704-%24t2ec16d%2C%21%29efipicdy1kbspli0kzy%21~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",224,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55738/', 'id': 55738, 'name': 'Indiana', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/indiana/4020-55738/'}]",The Fastest Man Dead!; Yellow is a Dirty Little Color!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40861/', 'id': 40861, 'name': ""Dennis O'Neil"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-oneil/4040-40861/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'penciler, inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9755/', 'id': 9755, 'name': 'Nick Cardy', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nick-cardy/4040-9755/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-8294/', 'id': 8294, 'name': 'Tatjana Wood', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tatjana-wood/4040-8294/', 'role': 'cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-224-the-fastest-man-dead-yellow-is-a-dir/4000-13754/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Suddenly, the theater is attacked by a giant, synthetic horse. Allen, as the Flash, aids in evacuating the theater, before it collapses under the massive steed's assault. When the Flash closes in to confront the horse, the crowd is astonished at what happens next. In Coast City, the Green Lantern is alerted to the Flash's peril. The Green Lantern travels to Central City, and confronts the horse. His power beam construct, however, dissipates before it can strike the horse. The horse seizes control of the power ring energy, reshaping it into a cannon, that shoots the Green Lantern out of the sky.</p><p>The Flash races the Green Lantern out of the horse's path, before he can be trampled to death. The Flash re-engages the horse, only to have his super-speed attack turned back on him again. The Green Lantern tries an indirect attack, hurling a large boulder at the horse. The rock shatters on the horse's hide, but does manage to break the horse's collar off. Inspecting the collar, the two heroes learn the horse originated in the 25th century. Journeying 500 years into the future, the two heroes learn that the ""Syntho-Steed"" was created by Eobard Thawne. The Syntho-Steeds were created to replace the now extinct horse in racing events. Thawne, though, is the Flash's greatest nemesis, Professor Zoom, also known as the Reverse Flash.</p><p>For creating the Syntho-Steeds, Thawne has been pardoned for all of his crimes. Thawne agrees to go back in time to aid the Flash in defeating the rampaging Syntho-Steed, with one condition. The Green Lantern must steal the priceless Raxalus Wings sculpture, and deliver it to Thawne. Though it violates his oath, the Green Lantern agrees to the crime, then beams the two speedsters back to the present. Within moments, crowds of onlookers see the Raxalus Wings sculpture launch itself into the sky. The Green Lantern is seconds away from taking possession of the sculpture, when he is thwarted by the Green Lantern of that era. The Green Lantern sends a power beam around the world, to strike his future counterpart in the back.</p><p>The Green Lantern quickly regains the sculpture, only to become caught in a power ring constructed cloud. Bombarded with emerald lighting, the Green Lantern loses his grip on the sculpture. Seeding the cloud, the Green Lantern creates a torrential downpour, that momentarily incapacitates his foe. Grabbing the statue on the run, the Green Lantern flees, only to be disintegrated by the future Green Lantern. The Flash and Professor Zoom run down the Syntho-Steed. Again, their super-speed powered attack is turned against them. The Flash merges his molecules with Professor Zoom, joining them together. Their super-speed powers combined, the two speedsters are able to fell the Syntho-Steed.</p><p>Stomping on the Syntho-Steed at super-speed, the Flash and Professor Zoom generate enough heat to melt the Syntho-Steed down into slag. True to his word, the Green Lantern delivers the Raxalus Wings to Professor Zoom. The moment Professor Zoom takes possession of the statue, it disintegrates. As the Raxalus Wings were yellow, the one color the Green Lantern's ring cannot affect, the Green Lantern could not protect the sculpture from the ravages of time travel. Professor Zoom accidentally confesses to sending the Syntho-Steed back in time, as a scheme to force the Green Lantern to steal the Raxalus Wings sculpture for him. The Flash removes Professor Zoom's costume from him, depriving him of his super-speed powers.</p><p>Professor Zoom is returned to the authorities of the 25th Century. Green Lantern reveals that he set his ring to return him to the present, the moment he was struck by his future counterpart's ring beam, thus escaping his seeming fate.</p>",,,,,,,False,13948,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4107686-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",225,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-47879/', 'id': 47879, 'name': 'Coast City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coast-city/4020-47879/'}]",Green Lantern: Master Criminal of the 25th Century!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9755/', 'id': 9755, 'name': 'Nick Cardy', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nick-cardy/4040-9755/', 'role': 'penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-8294/', 'id': 8294, 'name': 'Tatjana Wood', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tatjana-wood/4040-8294/', 'role': 'colorist, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-225-green-lantern-master-criminal-of-the/4000-13948/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-6992/', 'id': 6992, 'name': 'Green Lantern Corps', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Snart spends weeks, working in the prison infirmary, developing mesmerizing cold germs. A letter, carrying these germs, is sent to police forensic scientist, Barry Allen. Opening the letter, Allen is exposed to the germs, which plant a post-hypnotic command in Allen's mind to follow the instructions in the letter. Allen goes to the police evidence storeroom, and removes Snart's Captain Cold costume, and weaponry. On the street, a fellow officer informs Allen that Rory, as Heat Wave, is robbing a bank. Allen intervenes, as the Flash.</p><p>Heat Wave encloses the Flash in a ball of fire. Windmilling his arms, the Flash puts out the flames, then closes in on Heat Wave. Suddenly, in response to the post-hypnotic command he's under, the Flash races away. The Flash changes into Snart's Captain Cold costume and confronts Heat Wave. After causing Heat Wave to skid into a wall, by projecting a solid sheet of ice beneath Heat Wave's feet, ""Captain Cold"" blasts Heat Wave with his Cold Gun. Heat Wave defends himself by raising the outer temperature of his uniform to 1000 degrees. Heat Wave encases ""Captain Cold"" in rapidly closing walls of flame. Allen, hypnotically forced to fight Heat Wave to the death as Captain Cold, is too unfamiliar with Snart's Cold Gun to effectively use it to defend himself.</p><p>In his cell, Snart smugly ponders Allen's death, knowing that his murder will land Heat Wave back in jail. Heat Wave looks away as ""Captain Cold"" is consumed by the raging fire. The intense heat, and imminent peril, breaks Snart's hypnotic hold over Allen. Remembering that he is the Flash, Allen escapes the flames, and confronts Heat Wave, as the Flash. Caught in the Flash's slipstream, Heat Wave resists by setting the Flash's boots on fire. The Flash races into a nearby ice rink, to douse his boots, before beating Heat Wave into unconsciousness. Heat Wave, as Rory, is returned to prison, now sharing a cell with Snart. Believing that he had incinerated Snart, Rory becomes panic-stricken, believing his cellmate to be a ghost. Snart is beside himself with glee.</p><h3>The Powerless Power Ring!</h3><p>Camping in the wilderness, ex-test pilot, Hal Jordan, cooks up a batch of chili. To completely remove himself from civilization, Jordan throws his newspaper into the campfire, without reading it. Jordan, as the Green Lantern, recites his solemn oath, while recharging his power ring. For a moment, the sky is filled with brilliant colors, before quickly returning to normal. The Green Lantern choses sleep over investigation of the phenomena. The Green Lantern's slumber is disturbed by an approaching black bear. The Green Lantern attempts to run the bear off, with his power ring, only to see the emerald beam dissipate around the bear.</p><p>The Green Lantern elevates himself on a ring-constructed platform, until the bear wanders off. Testing his power ring, the Green Lantern accidentally shatters a tree, when his intentions were merely to lift it. A wave of nausea and vertigo assail the Green Lantern. A rock slide attracts the Green Lantern to an imperiled cliff climber. Not trusting his ring to make the save, the Green Lantern physically climbs the cliffside himself, as quickly as he can, to reach her. Just before he can, a second rockslide hurls him off the mountainside.</p><p>With no choice but to use the ring, the Green Lantern is gratified when it functions properly, allowing him to save both himself, and the girl from falling. Back at the Green Lantern's campsite, the girl discovers a discarded can of mushrooms, the contents of which were used, the night before, in the chili. Pulling out a newspaper, the girl shows the Green Lantern that the mushroom had been recalled. Apparently, hours after consumption, people found they could not properly operate motor vehicles. An effect that seems to apply to the operation of power rings, as well.</p>",,,,,,,False,14094,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4107644-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",226,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Hot-Cold War in Central City!; The Powerless Power Ring!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58440/', 'id': 58440, 'name': ""Heat Wave's Flamethrower"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heat-waves-flamethrower/4055-58440/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40861/', 'id': 40861, 'name': ""Dennis O'Neil"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-oneil/4040-40861/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1768/', 'id': 1768, 'name': 'Neal Adams', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neal-adams/4040-1768/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9755/', 'id': 9755, 'name': 'Nick Cardy', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nick-cardy/4040-9755/', 'role': 'artist, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-226-the-hot-cold-war-in-central-city-the/4000-14094/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The notorious criminal is placed in a holding cell, while the transport is checked out. Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, advises the officers <em>not</em> to remove Captain Boomerang's straitjacket, earning the villain's ire. As part of his escape plan, Captain Boomerang had seeded every jail cell in Central City with a hidden boomerang. Now, he uses that boomerang to cut himself free of his restraints, and don his criminal costume. Under cover of smoke, Captain Boomerang flees the station.</p><p>Before he leaves, though, he takes time out to attack Allen. The moment the boomerang strikes Allen, the police scientist disappears. Unbeknownst to Captain Boomerang, Allen is, secretly, the Flash, and uses his super-speed to escape injury. Allen, as the Flash, confronts Captain Boomerang outside the police station. The Flash generates hurricane force winds that blow Captain Boomerang along in front of him. Angling his body into the shape of a boomerang, Captain Boomerang becomes aerodynamic and is launched into the sky by the Flash's gale force winds.</p><p>Upon his return, Captain Boomerang slams into the Flash, knocking him unconscious. Captain Boomerang's father, the small time crook, ""Aussie Green"", joins his son to witness the Flash's demise. Frozen rigid with paralysis, the Flash is bent into the shape of a boomerang, then launched into a nightmarish dimension. The Flash merely waits to boomerang back to Captain Boomerang, easily navigating the horrors of the terrifying dimension without incident. At the sight of his foe, Captain Boomerang grabs his father and launches himself into the sky. The Flash generates a water spout, at super-human speed, and brings the two crooks back down to the ground, then carries them to jail.</p><h3><ins>""My Ring... My Enemy!""</ins></h3><p>Having rescued a young cliff climber from certain death, the Green Lantern harshly chastises the woman for ever having left the kitchen. After recharging his ring, the Green Lantern violently kicks his power battery away in disgust. Spying a helicopter in distress, the Green Lantern uses his power ring to bring it down safely. As soon as the rangers have exited the craft to thank the Green Lantern, the Emerald Gladiator belts one of them, and criticizes them for taking flight without properly checking the vehicle. The Green Lantern is informed that a family of campers are trapped within a forest fire.</p><p>Upon arriving on the scene, the Green Lantern finds a group of rangers standing around a disabled armored car, it's occupants unconscious. Belittling the rangers' competency, the Green Lantern begins a sweep of the forest. He quickly runs across a small prop plane being consumed by the flames. The Green Lantern next encounters a group of men, who clearly don't want his assistance in escaping the fire. It turns out the men are carrying stolen diamonds, and are the likely suspects in the armored car robbery.</p><p>After turning the thieves over to the rangers, the Green Lantern gets into an altercation with a ranger, for mouthing off to him. The Green Lantern savagely beats the ranger, nearly killing him. A moment of clarity washes over the Green Lantern, and he realizes that every time he uses his ring, he is compelled to do violence. Possibly the after effect of his exposure to a recent energy phenomena. Unfortunately, the family of campers is still lost in the forest fire, and the Green Lantern's power ring is the only possible way to rescue them.</p>",,,,,,,False,14234,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/12681-1995-14234-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",227,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Flash-- This Is Your Death!; My Ring...

After signing an autograph for the police officer's son, Bates gets back under way. A mysterious fog suddenly springs up before Bates. Navigating his way through the dense cloud, Bates comes out the other side to find himself driving, impossibly, into the fictional Central City. Pulling his car over to investigate, Bates is on the street when the Trickster emerges from a bank, and races into the air with the stolen loot. Almost instantly, the Flash arrives on the scene, generating a powerful sucking vortex to drag the Trickster back down to Earth.</p><p>The Trickster unleashes his newest weapon, a seemingly ordinary yo-yo. Under it's influence, the Flash suddenly breaks off his attack, and runs away. Bates drives over to the Allen home, and confronts Picture News reporter, Iris West, with information that no one could possibly know about her parents. West's husband, police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, enters the room. Bates lunges at Allen, activating the hidden spring on Allen's ring, releasing Allen's Flash costume. Allen, as the Flash, carries Bates to a remote location for some answers. Without revealing how he knows the things he does, Bates gives the Flash the location to the Trickster's hideout.</p><p>The Trickster's yo-yo begins spinning wildly, alerting him to the Flash's presence. Exposing the Flash, once more, to the yo-yo's emanations, places the Flash in a hypnotic trance. One in which he cannot perceive the Trickster. The Flash departs, leaving Bates behind, having completely forgotten him. Bates hitchhikes back to Central City, but returns to the Trickster's lair, late that night. While the Trickster sleeps, Bates swaps out the Trickster's yo-yo for an ordinary one. Bates then informs the Flash on where the Trickster will strike next. The Flash catches the Trickster in his slipstream, and races him through a carwash. After beating him into unconsciousness, the Flash returns the Trickster to jail. Bates drives through another fog bank to return to his proper dimension, having kept the Trickster's yo-yo as a reminder of his impossible adventure.</p><h3><ins>""My Enemy... Myself!""</ins></h3><p>Previously, a pair of aliens exposed the Green Lantern to an electrical discharge, meant to disable his power ring. Instead, it has had a psychological effect on the Green Lantern, making him increasingly violent with each use of his power ring. Park Rangers have called upon the Green Lantern to locate, and rescue, a boy scout troop caught, and lost, in a forest fire. With great umbrage, the Green Lantern agrees to the task, but not without binding the rangers with his power ring.</p><p>After creating a fire break with his power ring, the Green Lantern locates the boy scout troop. Just as the Green Lantern prepares to slaughter them, his power ring, acting on prior commands, binds the Green Lantern, then projects a protective bubble around the entire group. The moment the power ring reaches the end of it's charge, on the following day, the bubble melts away. While inside the bubble, the Green Lantern realizes the boy scout troop is merely an illusion, and destroys the device projecting then.</p><p>This act of destruction flushes out the aliens.

En route to Earth-2, Allen, as the Flash encounters the Walton Gang. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash takes possession of the Walton Gang's stolen loot, disarms them, then deposits them in front of the nearest patrol car. Garrick expresses her fears, to the Flash, that something is wrong with her husband.</p><p>The Flash seeks out his Earth-2 counterpart, who admits to being troubled. Over the past several days, the Golden Age Flash has been on hand to foil several robberies, committed by an old nemesis, the Rag Doll. Each time, the Rag Doll has been able to escape from the Golden Age Flash, due to inexplicable errors the Scarlet Speedster made, in attempting to apprehend the Rag Doll. After the third such error was particularly embarrassing, the Golden Age Flash has begun to think that he no longer has what it takes to be a crime fighter.</p><p>The Flash tries to console his counterpart, while offering words of encouragement. Suddenly, the Rag Doll runs past them. The two Flashes pursue the Rag Doll. Once again, the Golden Age Flash suffers a mishap, causing him to give up the chase. The Silver Age Flash, however, runs the Rag Doll to ground, then buries him up to his neck. The Silver Age Flash notices a strange luminous aura around both the Rag Doll's and the Golden Age Flash's heads, rousing his suspicion.</p><p>At police headquarters, the Rag Doll claims to have no memory of his robberies. The Rag Doll submits to a polygraph test to prove his sincerity. Horrifically, during the test, the Rag Doll seemingly transforms into a real, lifeless, rag doll. Despite the nightmarish quality of the mystery, the Silver Age Flash takes his leave of his counterpart, returning to his proper dimension. That night, in the darkened police laboratory, the Silver Age Flash confronts the true mastermind behind his counterpart's troubles, the Thinker.</p><p>The Silver Age Flash reveals that his departure was a ruse, and that he faked the Rag Doll's transformation to flush out the Thinker. Using the power of his thinking cap, the Thinker quickly subdues the Silver Age Flash. Suddenly, the Golden Age Flash races into the room. Quickly swapping helmets with the Thinker, faster than the eye can see, leaves the Thinker powerless. After beating the Thinker into unconsciousness, the two Flashes shake hands over a job well done, before the Silver Age Flash actually returns home.</p><h3><ins>Half A Green Lantern Is Better Than None!</ins></h3><p>This story was originally published in<a href=""/green-lantern-29-half-a-green-lantern-is-better-th/4000-7136/"" data-ref-id=""4000-7136""> Green Lantern #29</a> (June, 1964).

Two of the guards break off to engage the Green Lantern. In the course of dispatching them, the Green Lantern discovers they are robots. The Green Lantern follows the train into space, where it is brought aboard a mile-long space craft.</p><p>Using his power ring to gain entry, the Green Lantern disables the rest of the Colonial robots. Boarding the Spirit of 76, the Green Lantern encounters another robot, one designed to look like Aaron Burr. In order to get to the bottom of the mystery, the Green Lantern humors ""Burr"" by agreeing to a duel. Using his Power Ring, the Green Lanterrn redirects ""Burr's"" shot, while simultaneously disarming him. The Green Lantern places ""Burr"" in the same stasis field he placed the other Colonial robots in, only to see ""Burr"" walk out of it. It seems that Burr is not a robot, but is, incredibly, the real Aaron Burr. </p>",,,,,,,False,14722,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/13131-1995-14722-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",230,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56254/', 'id': 56254, 'name': 'Space', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/space/4020-56254/'}]",The Fury of The Fire-Demon!; The Man From Yesterday!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40861/', 'id': 40861, 'name': ""Dennis O'Neil"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-oneil/4040-40861/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33927/', 'id': 33927, 'name': 'Dick Dillin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-dillin/4040-33927/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9755/', 'id': 9755, 'name': 'Nick Cardy', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nick-cardy/4040-9755/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-32674/', 'id': 32674, 'name': 'Tex Blaisdell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tex-blaisdell/4040-32674/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-230-the-fury-of-the-fire-demon-the-man-f/4000-14722/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

For entertainment, each Rogue re-enacts his greatest battle with the Flash, altering the outcome so that the Rogue is triumphant. Meanwhile, police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, whips up a quick lunch for his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West. While preparing the salad, Allen works out a stratagem for taking down the Rogues. The Rogues are about to show off their latest innovations in their weapons' technology, when they are interrupted by a dandy, calling himself ""The Dude"".</p><p>The foppish felon claims to be the Flash's greatest foe, having bested him during each of their conflicts. Despite providing photographic proof of his victories, the Mirror Master demands to see the Dude defeat the Flash with his own eyes. Standing invisibly to bear witness, the Mirror Master watches as the Dude summons the Flash.  The two combatants square off in an epic duel. The Dude counters the Flash at every turn, ultimately defeating the Scarlet Speedster. The Mirror Master returns to the convention, and crowns the Dude ""Rogue Of The Year"". The Mirror Master reveals this year's award, an extremely valuable gemstone, heretofore hidden by one of the Mirror Master's illusions.</p><p>With the gemstone revealed, the Flash storms the convention hall. The Flash strips the Rogues, except for the Mirror Master, of their weapons and costumes, before they can react. The Mirror Master, though, has had time to get the drop on the Flash. The Flash blocks the Mirror Master's shot with Heat Wave's boot, causing his weapon to backfire on him. The Rogues defeated, the Flash, as the Dude, meets West at the theater. In order to take down the assembled Rogues, Allen infiltrated their ranks as ""The Dude"". Moving faster than the eye could see, Allen was able to stage the fight between the Dude and the Flash, for the Mirror Master's benefit. Allen enjoys the irony of being named ""Rogue Of The Year"", and looks forward to his foes' next convention.</p><h3><ins>""The Man Of Destiny!""</ins></h3><p>Astonishingly, the Green Lantern has met former Vice President, Aaron Burr, on a star ship. After sitting down to a dinner, served by Burr's android manservant, Ignatz, Burr tells his tale. He had been in the midst of his duel with Alexander Hamilton, when he was suddenly drawn to an alien world. The aliens replaced Burr, on Earth, with a clone of the former Vice President, freeing Burr up to take his place as <em>their</em> leader. After 170 years, despite Burr's best efforts, there are still pockets of dissent plaguing the alien world. As if to underscore that comment, Ignatz suddenly attacks Burr. The Green Lantern leaps to Burr's defense.</p><p>As he battles Ignatz, the giant android slowly turns color, until it's completely yellow. With his power ring useless against Ignatz's yellow coloring, the Green Lantern is forced to switch tactics. Cutting a hole in the starship's hull, the Green Lantern and Ignatz are sucked into space. Leaving Ignatz to drift helplessly in space forever, the Green Lantern rejoins Burr. Burr confesses to stealing the museum train, Spirit of 76, because he wanted to be near objects from his time again. The Green Lantern takes Burr back to Earth. After breathing in the air of his native world once more, Burr returns to his new world, unwilling to shirk his responsibilities. After returning the Spirit of 76 to Earth, the Green Lantern recharges his ring.</p><p><ins></ins> </p>",,,,,,,False,14931,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/13312-1995-14931-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",231,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56254/', 'id': 56254, 'name': 'Space', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/space/4020-56254/'}]",The Only Crook Flash Could Never Catch!;

Upon awakening, Kid Flash races for Central City, to garner the aid of his mentor, the Flash.</p><p>At that moment, Stacy Conwell, the daughter of murdered District Attorney candidate, Charles Conwell, pays a visit to Barry and Iris Allen. Having applied to Central State Junior College, Conwell is invited to stay with the Allens, until she hears back from the college. Upon seeing Kid Flash race into the room, Barry Allen shouts out loud, to cover his sidekick's words, before Conwell or West become aware of his presence. Kid Flash races backs out of the Allen household, quickly returning in his civilian garb. In private, West brings Allen up to speed on the threat from the Myrmitons.</p><p>Allen and West, as the Flash and Kid Flash, scour the streets of Central City for the android, known as ""Bio-X"".  They encounter the android, now aged into a small child. Bio-X flees from the Scarlet Speedsters. By the time they catch up to it, it has aged  into a teenager. Unexpectedly, Bio-X launches itself into the air, taking the Flash and Kid Flash with it. Turning their super-speed against them, the Scarlet Speedsters are spun like propellers, then released. By the time the Scarlet Speedsters have recovered and resumed the search for Bio-X, 6 hours have passed.</p><p>The Flash is the first to re-encounter Bio-X, now grown to adulthood. After a brief battle, wherein Bio-X proves to be just as fast as the Flash, if not faster, the Flash is rendered unconscious. By the time Kid Flash finds and revives him, another three and a half hours have elapsed. Two hours later, the Flash and Kid Flash, as Allen and West, pick up a hitchhiking Bio-X, now appearing as an elderly man, out on Highway 101. Gambling that Bio-X would not recognize them in their civilian identities, Allen and West seize Bio-X, and drag him over a geyser hole.</p><p>Without their super-speed to fuel him, Bio-X is helpless to resist as he is consumed in the blazing hot eruption. The blast, however, has no effect. Bio-X was engineered to be completely impervious to attack. The Scarlet Speedsters never had a chance of defeating it. With only seconds before the android's clock winds down, the Flash quickly places Bio-X in suspended animation, extending it's ""life"" forever. Conway is accepted at Central State Junior College. Allen reads a letter given to him by Conway's father, before he died. In the letter, the elder Conway requests the Allens look after his daughter, should she be accepted into college. Though it adds a complication in maintaining his secret identity, Allen agrees to Conway's last request.</p><h3><ins>Meet Kid Flash</ins></h3><p>A quick synopsis of who Wally West is, how he gained his super-speed powers, when the Flash revealed his identity to him, and how his costume was changed to it's current design.</p><h3><ins>The Duel Of The Super-Heroes!</ins></h3><p>This story was originally published in <a href=""/green-lantern-13-the-duel-of-the-super-heroes/4000-5907/"" data-ref-id=""4000-5907"">Green Lantern #13</a> (June, 1962).

Within the museum, the lifelike wax figure of the Flash has been laid prone, at the feet of wax figure replicas of<a href=""//www.comicvine.com/captain-cold/4005-2392/"" data-ref-id=""4005-2392""> Captain Cold</a>,<a href=""//www.comicvine.com/captain-boomerang/4005-29992/"" data-ref-id=""4005-29992""> Captain Boomerang</a>, <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/heat-wave/4005-7651/"" data-ref-id=""4005-7651"">Heat Wave</a>, and the <a href=""//www.comicvine.com/pied-piper/4005-10472/"" data-ref-id=""4005-10472"">Pied Piper</a>. A flash bulb alerts Myles, and the officer, to the presence of a reporter, who flees without identifying himself. Myles calls the home of police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. Allen's houseguest, Stacy Conwell, takes the call, while Allen listens in on another line. Conwell is surprised that Myles doesn't remember her. Allen, as the Flash, races over to the Flash Museum, arriving in time to thwart a robbery.</p><p>The Flash confesses to Myles that he set up the tableau. Furthermore, it was the Flash who posed as the reporter, then sent the photograph to the newspapers. This elaborate ruse has been set up to flush out an assassin called ""Saber-Tooth"". Through his underworld contacts, the Flash has become aware of Saber-Tooth's presence in Central City. Knowing that Saber-Tooth is gunning for him, the Flash made it seem as if one of his Rogues' Gallery also had a scheme in place to take down the Flash, in the hopes that it would force Saber-Tooth's hand. Myles reveals himself to be Saber-Tooth, at which point, the Flash really is struck down by the weapons of the wax replica Rogues.</p><p>After photographing the Flash's body, Saber-Tooth heads out to the woods, to dispose of the real Myles. Before he can murder Myles, a tree suddenly falls down upon him. Before it can hit, the tree is shredded into wooden strips, at super-human speed, which are then used to cage Saber-Tooth. The Flash reveals that he avoided Saber-Tooth's trap by vibrating his molecules into intangibility. The Flash knew all along that ""Myles"" was Saber-Tooth, because the real Myles never would have forgotten meeting the beautiful Conwell.</p><h3><ins>""And The Winner Is Death!""</ins></h3><p>On the planet, Que, an alien Sposm tank, and a terrestrial World War II era Sherman tank have been forced into combat with one another. Alien gamblers have laid out a wager on the outcome. Between the two tanks lies the unconscious body of the Green Lantern. Revived by his Power Ring, the Green Lantern deflects an attack from the human tank crew. Encasing the Sherman tank in a force field, the Green Lantern turns, just in time, to deflect an attack from the Sposm tank. The Sposm shell, however, was no ordinary explosive, but, in fact a blob of plasm.</p><p>Enough of the plasm strikes the Green Lantern to stagger him. Using their Omnitron, the aliens dissipate the Green Lantern's force field, surrounding the Sherman tank. The two tanks begin firing upon one another. Stray fire strikes the Omnitron, bathing the two aliens in it's aggression enhancing radiation. The aliens begin fighting, one viciously beating down the other. The alien victor, exhilarated by his triumph, charges the dueling tanks. Before the Green Lantern can end the combat, the alien is torn to pieces by the tanks' crossfire. The Green Lantern returns the two tanks to their proper places and times, leaving the surviving alien to grieve for his friend.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Superman in ""<strong>The Spy</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,15229,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/13583-1995-15229-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",234,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-50067/', 'id': 50067, 'name': 'Flash Museum', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-museum/4020-50067/'}]","""I'm Going to Kill you, Flash-- But Not Till I'm Good and Ready!""; And the Winner Is-- Death!","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40861/', 'id': 40861, 'name': ""Dennis O'Neil"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-oneil/4040-40861/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33927/', 'id': 33927, 'name': 'Dick Dillin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-dillin/4040-33927/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18186/', 'id': 18186, 'name': 'Ernie Chan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ernie-chan/4040-18186/', 'role': 'artist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4109/', 'id': 4109, 'name': 'Terry Austin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/terry-austin/4040-4109/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-32674/', 'id': 32674, 'name': 'Tex Blaisdell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tex-blaisdell/4040-32674/', 'role': 'writer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-234-im-going-to-kill-you-flash-but-not-t/4000-15229/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

His wife's absence fills Allen with a sense of unease. Suddenly, the kitchen door explodes outward, heralding the arrival of Vandal Savage. With a wave of his finger, Vandal Savage triggers Allen's costume ring, releasing his Flash costume. Allen, as the Flash races around Vandal Savage, who, incredibly, is still able to grab the Flash. Still vibrating at super-speed, the Flash is hurled backward, where he careens about the house, eventually doing so much destruction that the house collapses. Allen is shaken out of his reverie by his houseguest, Stacy Conwell. Allen finds himself still sitting at the dinner table.</p><p>The fight with Vandal Savage occurred entirely in his own mind. Communicating with Allen telepathically, Vandal Savage informs him that though their fight was merely an illusion, the danger to West is all too real. Allen arranges to have West's father, Professor Ira West, look after Conwell, to free him up to pursue Vandal Savage. Meanwhile, In Coast City, Hal Jordan says goodnight to his date, Carol Ferris. Remembering that he has theater tickets, Jordan returns to Ferris' apartment, only to find Vandal Savage waiting for him. Vandal Savage slams Jordan to the floor. As Jordan rises, he finds himself clad in his Green Lantern costume. The Green Lantern shoves Vandal Savage into a power ring constructed restraining chair, connected to a lie detector.</p><p>Vandal Savage, incredibly, stands up. The Green Lantern attacks with a power ring constructed hammer, only to find himself in his own chair, being struck by said hammer. Meanwhile, on Earth-2, the Golden Age Flash runs down some dope smugglers. He's somewhat surprised to receive an assist from the Flash and the Green Lantern. The two heroes have come to Earth-2 to inquire about Vandal Savage. The Golden Age Flash reveals that Vandal Savage was not, in fact, killed in their last encounter. Vandal Savage was thrown out of sync with Earth-2's vibratory rate, rendering him a phantom. Only on Earth-1 could Vandal Savage regain his corporeality. Though Vandal Savage is <em>his</em> nemesis, the Golden Age Flash opts not to join the Flash and the Green Lantern in taking him down.</p><p>Back on Earth-1, the Flash sees an image of West calling to him. This is followed by an image of Ferris calling to the Green Lantern. The two heroes follow these images into the deserted countryside. There, they find an enormous fireball, much like the one that had supposedly slain Vandal Savage. Ferris and West are trapped within the fireball, rapidly running out of oxygen. The best efforts of the Flash and the Green Lantern, to release West and Ferris, meet with failure. At one point, the Green Lantern is even knocked unconscious by his own attempt to extinguish the blazing ball of fire. After another failed attempt from the Flash, the Green Lantern reveals that he feigned unconsciousness, in order to focus all his efforts on finding Vandal Savage.</p><p>His hiding place revealed, Vandal Savage is compelled, by the Green Lantern's power ring, to explain his scheme. Vandal Savage could recharge his immortality from exposure to the fireball, but only after it had been exposed to both the Green Lantern's power ring energy, and the Flash's super-speed aura. Without Vandal Savage's psychic powers shielding the fireball, the Flash is, finally, able to extinguish it. Ferris, though, is the only one inside. Vandal Savage reveals that West was already missing when he came to abduct her. He merely took credit for her disappearance to manipulate the Flash. Crestfallen, the Flash worries if West is even alive. West, though, is very much alive, under the watchful eye of her abductor...the Golden Age Flash.</p>",,,,,,,False,15435,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/13774-1995-15435-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",235,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-47879/', 'id': 47879, 'name': 'Coast City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coast-city/4020-47879/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-40924/', 'id': 40924, 'name': 'Keystone City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keystone-city/4020-40924/'}]",Vandal Savage: Wanted Dead and Alive!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'penciler, inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-32674/', 'id': 32674, 'name': 'Tex Blaisdell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tex-blaisdell/4040-32674/', 'role': 'artist'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-235-vandal-savage-wanted-dead-and-alive/4000-15435/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

So intent is the Flash on his search, he inadvertently creates a monstrous tidal wave, with the wake from his super-speed. After rescuing all the swimmers he imperiled, the Flash dissipates the wave, before resuming his search. Meanwhile, on Earth-2, the Golden Age Flash is in the midst of a rescue of his own. He is joined by his Justice Society of America teammate, Doctor Fate. The Golden Age Flash has summoned Doctor Fate to assist in the treating of West. It is the Golden Age Flash who has abducted West. Along side his wife, Joan Williams, he is keeping West sequestered in his home.</p><p>To keep the Golden Age Flash's Earth-1 counterpart occupied, Doctor Fate casts the illusion of West around another girl. When the Flash, in his guise as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, sees ""West, he immediately races out to retrieve her. The Flash snatches ""West"" from the crowd. ""West"" repeatedly tells the Flash that she isn't his wife. Their argument is interrupted when an enormous, disembodied hand reaches out for them, from within the recently opened Putnam Tunnel. The hand slams the Flash into the ground, but the Scarlet Speedster merely vibrates his molecules fast enough to allow him to slip beneath the street.</p><p>The Flash circles around to the other end of Putnam Tunnel, to try to ambush the hand. As soon as the Flash enters, a second hand appears behind him. Caught between the two horrific hands, the Flash finds himself being bombarded with an enervating energy. The Flash races around and around the walls of the tunnel, spiraling out from the first hand's grasp. By the time he turns back to continue the conflict, the hands have vanished. Grabbing up ""West"" again, the Flash races her home. The Flash does everything in his power to convince ""West"" she is who he says she is, and that they are married.</p><p>Suddenly, the hand comes crashing through the wall. Fleeing with ""West"", the Flash runs headlong into the other hand. The Flash hurls ""West"" into the air, buries the hand with a tornado of rocks and soil, then catches ""West"" before she hits the ground, all without breaking his stride. The hands, though, are not so easily deterred, and soon, enough they are closing on the Flash, and ""West"", again. Doctor Fate fails to cure West of her affliction. The pestilence within her body, should it ever come in contact with the Flash's super-speed aura, would unleash a cataclysm of epic proportions. Doctor Fate removes the illusion of ""West"" he used to distract the Flash from his search, on Earth-1.</p><p>Only then does Doctor Fate realize that casting his spell across the dimensional void between the two Earths also created the ghostly hands. Worse, Doctor Fate cannot dissipate them. The Flash races towards the hands, veering off at the last second as they slam shut upon his after-image. The force of the hands' impact against one another dissipates them. Doctor Fate casts West into the 30th century, on Earth-1, where she hopes the advanced technology of that era can cure her. Using his Cosmic Treadmill, the Flash carries his search for West into the future, little suspecting that if he finds her, it could result in the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Shazam in ""<strong>Minerva Menace</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,15540,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/13872-1995-15540-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",236,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-40924/', 'id': 40924, 'name': 'Keystone City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keystone-city/4020-40924/'}]",Nowhere on the Face of Earth!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56063/', 'id': 56063, 'name': 'Helmet of Fate', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/helmet-of-fate/4055-56063/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6543/', 'id': 6543, 'name': 'Mike Grell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-grell/4040-6543/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-32674/', 'id': 32674, 'name': 'Tex Blaisdell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tex-blaisdell/4040-32674/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-236-nowhere-on-the-face-of-earth/4000-15540/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Having already gotten up to speed on the Cosmic Treadmill, the Flash moves off it, laterally, and travels to the year 2975 A.D. Knowing the Flash will eventually be coming for her, West leaves Central City, with her parents, Eric and Fran Russell. The Flash meets them on the road out of the city. Doctor Fate broadcasts a telepathic warning to the Flash, informing him that if he comes in contact with his wife, the results will be catastrophic. At the last second, the Flash veers off. Unfortunately, the Flash still came close enough to jeopardize Central City.</p><p>At super-human speed, the Flash shores up the tower that houses Central City. The cosmic storm ends as abruptly as it began, seemingly at the hands of Professor Zoom, the Reverse Flash. Professor Zoom reveals that it was he, in their last encounter, who instilled the lethal energies in West's body, using super-speed vibrations. That energy, over the intervening months, has built up to critical mass, and will be triggered by the Flash's own super-speed aura. It was for this reason that the Golden Age Flash abducted West, and brought her to Earth-2, in the hopes that Doctor Fate could reverse her condition. Doctor Fate could not.</p><p>In exchange for West's hand in marriage, Professor Zoom will. With West's agreement, Professor Zoom races her off to get married. The Flash pursues, taking his wife back, thus triggering the deadly chain reaction. An epic battle ensues between the rival super-speedsters, over West. Ultimately, the Flash defeats Professor Zoom, who flees back to his own time. Matching the exact same vibratory frequency Professor Zoom used to counter the first storm, the Flash calms the second. Further vibratory treatments eventually restore West to normal. After weeks of being apart, the Flash and West enjoy a happy reunion.</p><h3><ins>""Let There Be Darkness!""</ins></h3><p>The Green Lantern visits Earth's moon, to inspect the equipment left behind by the historic Apollo space mission. After protecting said equipment from a sudden avalanche, the Green Lantern is contacted by a Guardian of the Universe. After recharging his power ring, the Green Lantern journeys to the planet, Zerbon, to investigate a strange alien craft. The Green Lantern encounters the craft, emerging from Zerbon's ocean. After attempting to establish contact with the alien craft, the ship fires on the Green Lantern.</p><p>By the time the Green Lantern has recovered, the alien starship has constructed a barrier of meteor rock, in orbit, blocking Zerbon from the sun's rays. The sentient flora populace of Zerbon, cut off from the sun's rays, begin to starve. When the Green Lantern finds he cannot remove the barrier from orbit, he dives beneath Zerbon's ocean, discovering a strange alien device. Destroying the device allows him to move the barrier.

The bank's president, bizarrely, sealed himself inside his own vault.</p><p>Moving at super-speed, the Flash vibrates into the vault, but the man he pulls out is not the bank's president.

Shattering the vehicle with hyper-sonic waves, the Pied Piper then plays a tune that forces the guards to dance a jig. As luck would have it, the Flash happens to be passing by, before the Pied Piper can escape. Though the Pied Piper is quick to react, the Flash merely runs faster than the speed of sound, to avoid his attack. After subduing the Pied Piper with his own super-speed generated sonic boom, the Flash moves to secure the stolen money. Before he can, the money disappears into thin air. After turning the Pied Piper over to the authorities, the Flash heads home. En route, he encounters a traffic accident.</p><p>Though emergency vehicles are already on the scene, only the Flash notices a pool of gasoline expanding towards a lit cigarette. The gas ignites, but the Flash extinguishes it long before anyone can be injured. Stacy Conwell, the Flash's houseguest, in his guise as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, sees an image of herself, at the crash site, in the following day's newspaper. Conwell has no recollection of ever being there. Conwell watches a live newsfeed of the Flash's take down of the Trio Gang. The Flash subdues the Trio Gang by redirecting the stream from a fire hydrant, with his slipstream, and hurling at them.</p><p>Watching the same news story is Paul Gambi, the criminal tailor who outfitted all of the Flash's Rogues' Gallery with their costumes. In prison, Gambi shared a cell with Samuel Scudder, the Mirror Master. Scudder prodded Gambi into seeking revenge on the Flash for sending him to prison. Gambi, though, intended to go straight upon his release. As a gift, Gambi sewed an exact replica of the Flash's costume, and presented it to him, upon his release. En route to pick up his wife for dinner and a show, the Flash, as Allen, sees the Trickster running across the sky. After dodging the Trickster's barrage of exploding jacks, the Flash spirals up a lamppost, and brings his old enemy down to earth.</p><p>The Flash turns the Trickster over to the authorities. The Trickster's stolen money, though, vanishes the moment the Flash starts to hand it over. The Flash's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, reads him the riot act for being so late that their evening plans are ruined. The Flash snaps and lashes out at West, shearing a lamp stand in half. The Flash storms out his house, just as West's nephew, Wally, arrives. In tears, West relays to Wally the situation with both her husband, and her increasingly moody houseguest. Wally opts to deal with the Flash first, in his guise as Kid Flash. Kid Flash catches up to the Flash, in time to see him taking down the Top.</p><p>The Top's stolen jewels, too, also seem to vanish into thin air. Kid Flash, though, sees the truth. Moving so fast as to seem invisible to the normal eye, it is the Flash, himself, who has been absconding with the loot. Kid Flash follows the Flash out into the woods, where the Flash buries the Top's loot, returning to the jewelry store before anyone has noticed he's left. Kid Flash moves to retrieve the loot, only to encounter the Mirror Master. Kid Flash uses the polished facets of the Top's stolen jewels to reflect the Mirror Master attack, before subduing the Mirror Master. The Top makes a last ditch attempt to escape, only to be beaten into unconsciousness by the Flash.</p><p>The Flash and Kid Flash meet up at police headquarters, where they turn the Top and the Mirror Master over to the authorities. Questioning Gambi, the Scarlet Speedsters discover that the Mirror Master sabotaged the costume Gambi made for the Flash, in prison. Gambi stitches his trademark into every one of his costumes. The MIrror Master placed a mirror transceiver under the Gambi trademark in the Flash's costume. Through this transceiver, the Mirror Master was able to temporarily seize control of the Flash's mind, whenever he came in close proximity to another of Gambi's costumes. With the case closed, the Scarlet Speedsters return home. As Allen, the Flash apologizes to his wife, while West offers to speak with Conwell, about whatever has been troubling her.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Shazam in ""<strong>The Cup Cake Caper</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,16045,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/14343-1995-16045-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",239,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",The Tailor-Made Crimes of Central City!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58438/', 'id': 58438, 'name': ""Captain Boomerang's Boomerangs"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-boomerangs-boomerangs/4055-58438/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58436/', 'id': 58436, 'name': 'Mirror Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-gun/4055-58436/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58441/', 'id': 58441, 'name': ""Top's Trick Tops"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tops-trick-tops/4055-58441/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58442/', 'id': 58442, 'name': ""Trickster's Gadgets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tricksters-gadgets/4055-58442/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18186/', 'id': 18186, 'name': 'Ernie Chan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ernie-chan/4040-18186/', 'role': 'penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-239-the-tailor-made-crimes-of-central-ci/4000-16045/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

At that moment, Conwell, as if in a trance, bears witness to a traffic accident, in Central City. The Flash, in his guise as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, sees a photograph of Conwell, at the scene of the accident. Returning home, Allen speaks with West, who has recovered torn pages from Conwell's diary, from the trash. In the hopes of discerning the whole story, West has sent Kid Flash off after the trash collector, to retrieve any more pages from the diary. Kid Flash catches up with the truck, after it has deposited it's load in the incinerator.</p><p>At super-human speed, Kid Flash sifts through Central City's garbage, inside the incinerator, retrieving the diary pages before they are destroyed. From her writings, it appears Conwell is being haunted by the ghost of her sister, Sarah, who died in an automobile collision. Keeping a watchful eye on Conwell, the Flash and Kid Flash follow her to the scene of another automobile accident. Thanks to the presence of the Scarlet Speedsters, disaster is averted on the interstate, though Kid Flash sprains his ankle. The Flash, as Allen, reveals to Conwell that she isn't being haunted by a her sister's ghost. It is, in fact, Conwell herself who has been sleepwalking to all these accident scenes. Under hypnosis, Conwell reveals that she saw an alien ship crash, in the woods.</p><p>The ship broadcast a distress signal directly into Conwell's brain. Ever since that moment, Conwell gained a precognitive ability to predict vehicular accidents, as well as a compulsion to bear witness to them. Allen, as the Flash, investigates the alien crash site. The Flash, too, receives the alien distress signal, and immediately races off to Canada. There, the Flash uses his super-human speed to generate enough heat friction to de-ice a runway, allowing a small plane to land safely. Returning to the alien crash site, the Flash receives the distress signal again. Realizing that the robot craft itself is about to explode, the Flash buries it deep beneath the ground, rendering it's detonation harmless. The automated distress signal goes silent in Conwell's brain, returning her to normal.</p><p>""The Floods Will Come!""</p><p>Having thwarted two of the six ""Holy"" tasks of the Ravagers of Olys, the Green Lantern departs the Vivarium, intent on stopping a third. One of the Vivarium's inhabitants, an alien creature known as an ""Ayrie"" travels with the Green Lantern. Though the tiny creature is incapable of speech, the Green Lantern, nonetheless, welcomes the company. The Green Lantern dubs the creature ""Itty"". Spying a comet about to impact with the Vivarium, the Green Lantern deflects it with his power ring. After recharging his power ring, the Green Lantern tracks the Ravagers of Olys to the planet, Archos.</p><p>With a ravager ship already in orbit over the planet, the Green Lantern investigates what new peril the Ravagers have instigated. On the planet's surface, the Green Lantern sees a massive tidal wave crashing down on the primitive inhabitants of Archos. The Green Lantern bars the wave with a power ring constructed dam of Archos soil. Quickly, the Green Lantern determines that the water level of Archos is rapidly rising, threatening the entire planet's population. The Green Lantern boards the Ravager's ship, to confront his foes. A blue-ape like creature closes on the Green Lantern.</p><p>The Green Lantern is just about to blast his adversary with a power ring beam, Itty encircles his ring. Itty attracts the Green Lantern's eye to a projector. Realizing the creature is a hologram, the Green Lantern walks through it, discovering a large mirror behind it. Had the Green Lantern unleashed the full force of his power beam, it's energy would have been redirected back at him. The Green Lantern realizes the robot ship is controlling the comet that nearly hit the Vivarium. The same comet that has created the cataclysm on Archos. Using the Olys mirror to repel the lingering comet trail encircling Archos, the Green Lantern restores the planet to normal.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Shazam in ""<strong>The Cup Cake Caper</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,16131,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/14425-1995-16131-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",240,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55868/', 'id': 55868, 'name': 'Canada', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/canada/4020-55868/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54944/', 'id': 54944, 'name': 'Space Sector 2814', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/space-sector-2814/4020-54944/'}]",Collision Course with Disaster!; The Floods Will Come!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40861/', 'id': 40861, 'name': ""Dennis O'Neil"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-oneil/4040-40861/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18186/', 'id': 18186, 'name': 'Ernie Chan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ernie-chan/4040-18186/', 'role': 'penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6543/', 'id': 6543, 'name': 'Mike Grell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-grell/4040-6543/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-32674/', 'id': 32674, 'name': 'Tex Blaisdell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tex-blaisdell/4040-32674/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-240-collision-course-with-disaster-the-f/4000-16131/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

After an epic clash, the Flash flees. Scott comments on the ongoing mystery as to why the two adversaries have seemingly switched roles. This is the third time the Flash has committed a crime that the Mirror Master, who is, himself, a wanted fugitive for escaping prison, failed to stop. Scott airs footage of the Flash's prior two escapes from the Mirror Master. The Mirror Master, it seems, is no better a hero, than he was a villain.</p><p>Despite their role reversal, the Flash still comes out on top, In reality, this is all part of a larger scheme of the Mirror Master, to finally defeat the Flash once and for all. Phoning in a tip, the Mirror Master had lead the Flash into a Hall of Mirrors. There, the Flash was brainwashed into believing that he had always been a master thief. As the Flash's heroic nature struggles against his criminal brainwashing, the MIrror Master notices that he comes closer and closer to, finally, defeating his old foe. Having failed to convince her husband that he's not in his right mind, Picture News Reporter, Iris West, enlists the aid of Flash Museum curator, Dexter Myles, to restore the Flash's mind.</p><p>The Flash makes a move to rob the Emerald Exposition, only to find the Mirror Master waiting for him. Before the Mirror Master can bring his newest mirror weapon to bear, Heat Wave burns his way in, through the ceiling. Despite his protestations that the Mirror Master is the hero, Heat Wave attacks the Flash. With Heat Wave's intrusion ruining his gambit, the Mirror Master opts to flee, before the police arrive. Heat Wave offers the Flash a truce, until they've dealt with the Mirror Master. Literally running on the beam from Heat Wave's gun, the Flash races into the sky, in pursuit of the Mirror Master.</p><p>Bringing his old foe down to Earth, the Flash turns the Mirror Master over to the authorities. The Flash whisks ""Heat Wave"" away to the Flash Museum, where the fiery felon's identity is revealed to be Myles. The Flash doesn't have the heart to reveal that he had already broken Mirror Master's conditioning, before Myles arrived, impersonating Heat Wave. The Flash had noticed that the Mirror Master was always tense around the police, while the Flash remained calm, indicating that they were behaving opposite to their true nature.</p><h3><ins>""To Kill A Star!""</ins></h3><p>The Green Lantern has thwarted three of the six ""Holy"" tasks of the Ravagers Of Olys. At the behest of one of the Guardians of the Universe, the Green Lantern heads to the planet, Jotham. The Guardian urges the Green Lantern to take one of the Ravager's ships with him to Jotham. Before the Guardian can explain why, cosmic storm radiation disrupts his transmission.</p><p>After recharging his power ring, the Green Lantern tows the derelict Ravager ship to Jotham. The Ravagers of Olys fire on the Green Lantern, as a distraction, while missiles are fired into the Jotham sun. The Green Lantern uses the derelict ship to block the Ravagers' weapons' fire. The intense gravity of the Jotham sun bends the Green Lantern's power beam away from the fleeing Ravagers.</p><p>A quick check with his power ring confirms that the Jotham sun is cooling down. The Green Lantern confers with the ruling body of Jotham, in the hopes that they have a nuclear weapon capable of re-igniting their sun. The Jotham do not. Using his power ring, the Green Lantern modifies the derelict ship's reactors into the kind of bomb he needs to re-ignite the Jotham sun.

The Flash is confronted by a trio of bank robbers, all of whom seem to be composed of living electricity. Maneuvering around their electrical barrage, the Flash divests the Electric Gang of their stolen loot. After a second electrical assault fails, the Electric Gang completely converts their bodies into pure electricity, and escapes through the phone lines. The bank security guard mentions a prior encounter the Flash had with the Electric Gang. The Flash has no recollection of it. Unnoticed by the Flash, as he speaks with the guard, Samuel Scudder, the notorious Mirror Master, enters the bank to make a, legal, withdrawal. The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, meets his wife, Picture News Reporter, Iris West, for lunch.</p><p>West confirms that Allen did, indeed, lose a battle to the Electric Gang several days ago. After West leaves for work, Allen spies her riding in the back of a taxi cab. Allen follows, as the Flash. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash tails West to the Central City Medical Center. Unbeknownst to either the Flash, or West, the clouds above them mask the arrival of the Weather Wizard. Conferring with a doctor, the Flash learns that the Electric Gang powers themselves with the natural electrical aura of their victims. The sudden absorption of the body's natural electric charge temporarily paralyzes the body. West's investigative research into the Electric Gang's robberies has led to a connection to the Ace Floor Cleaning Company. Their company provided floor cleaning services to each of the crime scenes the day prior to the Electric Gang's robberies.</p><p>West surreptitiously watches the cleaning crew do the floors at the Soames Stamp Store. With her attention riveted on the cleaning crew she suspects to be the Electric Gang, West completely misses the figure of Captain Boomerang, as he bounds across the rooftops. Moving so fast as to be invisible, the Flash continues to stalk West. Wondering why she would keep her visit to the doctor a secret from him, the Flash determines that West <em>must</em> be pregnant. West returns to the Soames Stamp Store, just in time to encounter the Electric Gang, mid-robbery. With a single step, West short-circuits the Electric Gang, revealing them to, in fact, be the Ace Floor Cleaning Company crew. Still carrying enough of charge to be threat, the Electric Gang fire on West. The Flash rescues West.</p><p>Moving so fast his feet never actually touch the floor, the Flash is immune to the Electric Gang's charge. They themselves, however, are not, as the Flash proves by re-directing their charge back into them. West learned that, as the Ace Floor Cleaning Company crew, the Electric Gang laid down a special chemical coating on the floors, which allowed them to absorb their victim's body electricity. West began visiting a doctor, to receive special shock treatments, that would allow her to negate the Electric Gang's electrical fields. West actually revealed all of this to the Flash before but, as with his first encounter with the Electric Gang, the Flash has no recollection of any of it. Meanwhile, in a warehouse across the street, the Mirror Master, the Weather Wizard and Captain Boomerang, are joined by their fellow Rogues, Captain Cold, Heat Wave and the Trickster. The Rogues' Gallery has come together to mourn the death of one of their own.</p><h3><ins>""All Creatures Great And Small!""</ins></h3><p>Having thwarted the schemes of the Ravagers of Olys four times, the Green Lantern pursues them to Earth. One of the Ravagers leaves their ship, outfitted with a jet pack. As the Ravager flies low over a hidden valley in India, he releases a cloud of dust. The Green Lantern attacks the Ravager of Olys. After a savage fist fight, the Green Lantern mercilessly beats the Ravage of Olys into unconsciousness. Standing victorious over his opponent, the Green Lantern is attacked by a giant fly. Using his power ring, the Green Lantern creates an energy construct of a spider, to deal with the fly. After recharging his ring, the Green Lantern investigates the effects of the Ravager's dust on the valley.</p><p>The Green Lantern sees a monstrous flea menacing a miniaturized elephant, and a mammoth tick terrorizing a tiny tiger. After rescuing the imperiled animals, the Green Lantern seals off the valley, to keep the monstrous insects from escaping. Using his power ring, the Green Lantern triggers a torrential downpour. With the rain washing the dust away, the effects on the valley's inhabitants are reversed. The Green Lantern blasts the jet pack off the Ravager, as he attempts to flee back into space. With the Ravager his prisoner, the Green Lantern forces his alien foe to reveal their next target.

A half dozen of the Flash's Rogues' Gallery gather to mourn their fallen compatriot in crime. An emergency beacon top alerted the Mirror Master to the Top's fate. Now, the Mirror Master plays a cassette recording of the Tops' last words, for his fellow Rogues. A week ago, the Top had robbed an express train, carrying a ten million dollar gold shipment. The Top completed the crime, utilizing his newly discovered mind over matter power. The Top leapt from the train, with a whirling top of gold bars spinning behind him. By chance, the Flash happened to be on the scene. With the Flash bearing down on him, the Top telekinetically raised a massive top-shaped mound of Earth.</p><p data-right-indent=""0"" data-left-indent=""0"">With the Earth spinning beneath his feet, the Flash held on for dear life, as the top launched itself into the air. Racing in the opposite direction to the top's spin, the Flash is able to slow it down. Having safely fled, the Top released the Earth top, which plummeted to the ground. Vibrating his molecules at super-human speed, the Flash became insubstantial, and passed harmlessly into the ground, without injury. While the Mirror Master turns the cassette over, the Rogues respond to the Top's theory on the Flash's secret identity. After the successful completion of the gold heist, the Top suffered a bout of agonizing pain. Running a battery of tests, the Top learned that he was dying.</p><p data-right-indent=""0"" data-left-indent=""0"">Close proximity to the Flash's super-speed vibrations had set off a chain reaction within the Top's own super-charged cells, derived from years of high-velocity spinning. The Top would be dead in a matter of days. As a final farewell to the Flash, the Top went on a crime spree. Though he suffered ever closer calls with each robbery, the Top ultimately managed to outwit the Flash at every turn, for six straight crimes. The Flash, clearly furious over the Top's string of success, held a press conference, and vowed to bring the Top to justice. The Top's last crime was particularly baffling for the Flash, as it was simply a stolen tape recorder.</p><p data-right-indent=""0"" data-left-indent=""0"">Knowing his time was at an end, the Top recorded his last message for his fellow Rogues, then sent for the Mirror Master. The Top's very last words, are the most chilling. For each of his final robberies were merely a ruse, to conceal the fact that he planted a powerful explosive device at each crime scene. The bombs are set to go off at Midnight, on June 30, 1976. The resulting blast will devastate Central City. The only way to stop the countdown is to stack all six explosives on top of one another. The Rogues will have to commit the Top's exact same crimes to retrieve the bombs. The Top is counting on the Flash to stop just one of the Rogues, thus, inadvertently, dooming his own city to destruction.</p><h3><ins>Dust of the Earth!</ins></h3><p data-right-indent=""0"" data-left-indent=""0"">The Ravagers of Olys have been on a ""Holy"" mission to complete six tasks of planetary destruction, throughout space sector 2814. They have embarked on this terrible crusade in order to garner placement within a large galactic federation. Said federation tasked the Ravagers of Olys with reversing the Hebrew Bible's story of creation, as proof that they were worthy of joining their enclave. The Green Lantern has thwarted the Ravagers of Olys at every turn. Now, on Earth, he interrogates his prisoners. Before the Green Lantern was able to disable the Ravager's ship, they exposed him to a ""Reversion Ray"". In moments, the Green Lantern devolves into a primitive savage.</p><p data-right-indent=""0"" data-left-indent=""0"">It is a fate the Ravagers of Olys intend for all humankind. Acting solely on an instinctual level, the Green Lantern still recognizes the Ravagers of Olys as his enemies. Riding atop a power ring constructed, winged sabre-tooth tiger, the Green Lantern descends upon the Ravager's ship. Fearing they will be horribly slaughtered by the raging savage, the Ravagers rapidly re-evolve the Green Lantern. Possibly still fueled by his primitive fury, the Green Lantern orders the Ravagers of Olys off Earth, with a veiled threat of the terrible fate that will befall them should they ever return. The crisis over, the Green Lantern recharges his ring.</p>",,,,,,,False,16559,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/14835-1995-16559-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url':

Police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, and his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, attend the Top's funeral. Allen overhears a police radio bulletin, regarding a bank robbery. Allen, as the Flash, races to the scene of the crime, to confront Captain Boomerang. As the Flash closes on him, Captain Boomerang summons a fleet of remote controlled, flying boomerangs. The Flash sets up an air brake with his super-speed, inadvertently powering up the boomerangs. After a grazing blow nearly lays him out, the Flash flees, with the boomerangs in hot pursuit. The boomerangs keep pace with the Flash, even vibrating so fast as to pass harmlessly through solid objects. Out on a lake, the Flash whips up a column of water, trapping the boomerangs, and causing them to detonate.</p><p>Returning to the scene of the crime, the Flash is astonished to learn that Captain Boomerang didn't steal a single penny. Captain Boomerang meets up with the Weather Wizard and Heat Wave, back at their secret lair. All three men have successfully retrieved an explosive device, planted by the Top, at three of the Top's last six crime scenes. Knowing that he was dying, the Top decided to take Central City with him, by planting the six explosives around the city. The only way to stop the detonation is to collect all of the explosives, and stack them atop one another. The Rogues have set out to do just that, but the Top is counting on the Flash to stop them, thus dooming his own city to destruction. Having retrieved his part of the explosive, Captain Cold rampages through the streets of Central City, freezing everything in his sight.</p><p>Building up heat friction at super-human speed, the Flash melts the ice, and uses the sudden flood water to overwhelm Captain Cold. Once again, the Flash discovers that nothing has been stolen from the crime scene. Emptying Captain Cold's bag, the Flash finds the Top's explosive. Uncertain as to what he's dealing with, the Flash, as Allen, studies the disc-shaped device, back in the laboratory, at police headquarters. The Rogues fume over Captain Cold's failure. Under a literal cloud of invisibility, the Weather Wizard elects to break into police headquarters and retrieve the explosive. At dinner, Allen looks over his wife's research material on the Top, and suddenly realizes the purpose of the disc-shaped device. Allen races back to police headquarters, only to find that the device has been stolen.</p><p>On the local news, Allen watches a live feed of the Trickster, escaping from the Ace Fur Company, having just robbed it. Having figured out the true motivation behind the Rogues' non-robberies, Allen does nothing to interfere with the Trickster's escape. Allen determines where the final bomb will be, and heads out, as the Flash. The Central City police have also figured out the Rogues' pattern, and have surrounded the Central National Bank. When the Mirror Master appears on the scene, the Flash takes steps to prevent the police from interfering with the Mirror Master's retrieval of the device. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash employs tactics that not only prevents the police from taking action against the Mirror Master, but also keeps the Mirror Master from ever knowing the police are even there.</p><p>As the Mirror Master heads back to his secret lair, the Flash follows. The Flash, though, has underestimated the Mirror Master. Spying the Flash in his rearview mirror, the Mirror Master fires his distortion gun at the Flash, without even bothering to look back. The Mirror Master arrives at the hideout, with the final piece of the Top's bomb, and the horrifically warped body of the Flash. Stacking the explosives atop one another activates a pre-recorded message from the Top. The explosives have to be stacked in an exact configuration. Worse, the Rogues have only 60 seconds, to work through 720 possible combinations, before the bomb detonates. With the Rogues frantically stacking the explosives, the Flash has time to reconfigure his molecular structure, returning it to normal. Taking over for the Rogues, the Flash runs through all 720 combinations, until the bomb is disarmed. The crisis averted, the Flash rounds up the Rogues, then returns home to his wife.</p>",,,,,,,False,16643,"{'icon_url':

Twelve hours later, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is demonstrating some simple science experiments to a young boy, Jimmy. When one of Allen's chemical tricks goes awry, Allen notices a strange trail of radiation, leading away from the laboratory. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Trailing a little too closely to the radiation trail, the Flash is suddenly caught in the beam, and carried across town. Unable to escape from the radiation beam, the Flash is rendered unconscious, when he slams into the outer wall of the Central National Bank.</p><p>Upon recovery, the Flash realizes that the radiation beam followed the self same trail he left the night before, when he carried the Zinger Gang members from the bank to police headquarters. The Flash heads back to the laboratory to do some further research on the Zinger gang's signature weapon, the Zinger. After the Zinger Gang pulls off another robbery, the Flash spends the day crisscrossing the entirety of Central City. Twelve hours after the robbery was committed, the Flash sees another radiation trail emanating from his home. Multiple trails form across Central City, as the Zinger radiation interacts with the Flash's residual super-speed vibrations.</p><p>The entire city becomes gridded by the Zinger radiation, allowing the Flash to attune his vibratory rate to the trail that will lead him back to the Zinger Gang. The Flash is drawn to Rosario Jewelers, where he encounters the Zinger Gang, mid-robbery. The Flash quickly takes down the entire gang. The Flash, as Allen, shows Jimmy another chemical experiment in the laboratory. Once again, an inexplicable effect occurs during Allen's experiment. Realizing the Zinger radiation is not the cause, Allen realizes that something else is afoot.</p><h3><ins>""Perilous Plan Of The Plant-Master!""</ins></h3><p>The Green Lantern is taking his alien companion, Itty, on a tour of Northwestern California. Suddenly, two redwoods launch themselves into the air in front of them. As the Green Lantern moves in to corral the two trees, they divest themselves of their leaves, blinding the Green Lantern. Alerted to incoming peril by Itty, the Green Lantern saws the trees, then pulps them into paper. After recharging his ring, the Green Lantern is assaulted by choking vines. Utilizing it's alien senses, Itty tracks the trouble back to a hidden, underground laboratory.</p><p>There Itty encounters Jason Woodrue, the self-styled Plant-Master. Itty observes while Woodrue downs a serum that transforms him from animal to vegetable. Now calling himself ""The Floronic Man"", Woodrue decides to test his newly born power to control the plant kingdom. The Floronic Man opens with a whirlwind barrage of seeds, to buffet the Green Lantern. The Green Lantern collects the seeds in a power-ringed construct, and sows them into the ground. Itty makes contact with the Green Lantern, but the Emerald Gladiator fails to heed the tiny alien's warning. With the Green Lantern distracted, the Floronic Man closes in for the kill.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Aquaman in ""<strong>Twinkies and Kelp</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,16828,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/15086-1995-16828-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",245,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55716/', 'id': 55716, 'name': 'California', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/california/4020-55716/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Who Put The Zing in The Flash?; Perilous Plan of The Plant-Master!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55747/', 'id': 55747, 'name': 'Green Power Battery', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-battery/4055-55747/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40861/', 'id': 40861, 'name': ""Dennis O'Neil"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-oneil/4040-40861/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33927/', 'id': 33927, 'name': 'Dick Dillin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-dillin/4040-33927/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18186/', 'id': 18186, 'name': 'Ernie Chan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ernie-chan/4040-18186/', 'role': 'penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-8294/', 'id': 8294, 'name': 'Tatjana Wood', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tatjana-wood/4040-8294/', 'role': 'colorist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4109/', 'id': 4109, 'name': 'Terry Austin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/terry-austin/4040-4109/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-245-who-put-the-zing-in-the-flash-perilo/4000-16828/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

As Marston's bowling ball rolls down the alley, it begins to increase in size and speed, ultimately smashing through the back wall. Allen goes after Marston's bowling ball, as the Flash.</p><p>Intercepting the rolling juggernaut, the Flash vibrates into the bowling ball, to shatter it from within. This is the third inexplicable, physics defying phenomena to occur in the Flash's presence, over the last few days. The Flash decides to return to police headquarters, the site of the first phenomena. The Flash uncovers a golden pyramid, hidden on a shelf in his laboratory.</p><p>The moment the Flash picks up the pyramid, he is transported, in time, to the 64th Century. The Flash's attention is drawn to the sound of applause. A large crowd has gathered about the Flash's arch-nemesis, Abra Kadabra, and are showering the malevolent magician with praise. The police inform the Flash that it's all part of Abra Kadabra's rehabilitation.</p><p>As Abra Kadabra was driven to commit crime out of some psychotic craving for admiration, he receives constant applause to both fulfill that need, as well as suppress his criminal urges. The golden pyramid begins to pulse with light. Suddenly, the Flash bolts out of police headquarters, and tears off after Abra Kadabra. Against his very will, the Flash feels compelled to murder Abra Kadabra.</p><p>After beating the magician mercilessly, at super-human speed, the Flash finally delivers the high-velocity killing blow. Abra Kadabra seemingly disintegrates on impact. The Flash is swiftly arrested by the authorities, for the cold-blooded murder of Abra Kadabra.</p><h3><ins>Fury Of The Floronic Man!</ins></h3><p>The Green Lantern's alien companion, Itty, desperately tries to warn the Green Lantern of impending danger. At the command of the Floronic Man, branches and tree limbs rain down upon the Green Lantern. The Green Lantern protects himself with a power ring constructed umbrella.The Floronic Man raises a cactus. With the Green Lantern focused on protecting himself from the barrage of tree limbs, the Floronic Man hurls a cactus needle into the Green Lantern's neck. The Green Lantern immediately begins acting erratically, as the sting of the cactus needle instills a temporary insanity upon him.</p><p>The Green Lantern flies into a redwood, knocking himself unconscious upon impact. The Green Lantern awakens completely covered in tree sap. To make matters worse, his power ring is in the possession of the Floronic Man. While the Floronic Man outlines his evil schemes for world domination, Itty uses the power ring to free the Green Lantern. Reclaiming his power ring, the Green Lantern uses it to freeze the moisture in the ground, and the air, encasing the Floronic Man in ice. His opponent defeated, the Green Lantern recharges his power ring.

The malevolent magician, however, is actually alive, having just materialized on Earth-2, in Keystone City, in the year 1976. Unaware of the existence of Earth-2, Abra Kadabra erroneously believes he has materialized on Earth-1, in Central City. His confusion only grows when he is drawn to a crowd of admirers, all of whom have gathered to praise the Golden Age Flash.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the year 6376, the Flash executes his 36th escape attempt from his cell. The walls and floor of the cell are outfitted with special plates that match the Flash's vibratory rate, preventing him from vibrating his molecules through the walls at super-speed. After being repelled yet again, the Flash switches tactics. This time the Flash allows his momentum to ricochet him off the walls, in the hopes that the response time of the plating will be off, just enough, to allow him to escape. The walls hold.</p><p>Ultimately, the Flash is rendered unconscious, from his multiple impacts with the walls, ceiling and floor of his cell. Abra Kadabra is at a loss to explain the changes in his surroundings, and in the Flash himself. In order to confirm that the Golden Age Flash is, in fact, his old foe, Abra Kadabra draws him out with an illusion. The Golden Age Flash recognizes Abra Kadabra, from pictures the Silver Age Flash has shown him. The Golden Age Flash races to confront Abra Kadabra.</p><p>The Golden Age Flash spins at super-human speed to repel the giant, solidified musical notes Abra Kadabra has hurled at him. Anticipating that particular super-speed tactic, Abra Kadabra tosses his cape at the Golden Age Flash's spinning form. The fabric wraps tightly around the Golden Age Flash, suffocating him. The Flash hurls the chair in his cell at the wall. While the plating is responding to the chair's vibratory rate, the Flash is able to slip through the walls of his cell.</p><p>The Flash is immediately attacked by a pair of security robots. The Flash shakes them to pieces, then flees. With the Golden Age Flash paralyzed, and levitating before him, Abra Kadabra conducts an interrogation. Realizing that Abra Kadabra is confused, the Golden Age Flash decides to play into Abra Kadabra's delusion, to garner information. Abra Kadabra reveals how he tricked the Golden Age Flash's counterpart into coming to the future, and ""murdering"" him.</p><p>Abra Kadabra was seemingly disintegrated by the Flash's high-velocity killing blow. In reality, Abra Kadabra's molecules were shunted back in time. Unbeknownst to Abra Kadabra, he was also shunted through dimensional space, arriving on Earth-2, instead of Earth-1. The Golden Age Flash keeps silent, prompting Abra Kadabra to level his wand at him, and blast the Golden Age Flash into oblivion. Using one of the security robots, the Flash recreates the murder of Abra Kadabra.</p><p>Matching vibratory rates with the robot, the Flash is drawn back through time, and across the dimensional gulf, to Earth-2. Instantly recognizing his surroundings, the Flash scours Keystone City, in search of his counterpart. The Flash rescues the Golden Age Flash, ferrying him away before Abra Kadrabra's wand can strike. The Flash breaks the Golden Age Flash's paralysis with a super-speed massage, then confronts Abra Kadabra. Abra Kadabra conures a giant banana peel in front of the Flash, causing him to go flying through the air.</p><p>The Golden Age Flash catches his Silver Age counterpart, then both men join forces against Abra Kadabra. Abra Kadabra is baffled at the existence of two Flashes. In his bewilderment, he is easy prey for the Scarlet Speedsters, who recreate Abra Kadabra's ""murder"" once more. Abra Kadabra is hurled back to the future, where he is picked up by the authorities. Abra Kadabra continually irritates his jailers, with a wild tale of two Flashes, two Earths, and two cities. All of which seemed to be one thing, but, were, in fact, different. Meanwhile, the two Flashes sit down with Joan Garrick, the wife of the Golden Age Flash, for a pot roast dinner.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Aquaman in ""<strong>That Dirty Beach</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,17233,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/15458-1995-17233-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",247,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-40924/', 'id': 40924, 'name': 'Keystone City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keystone-city/4020-40924/'}]","The Mad, Mad Earth Of Abra Kadabra!""",[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-247-the-mad-mad-earth-of-abra-kadabra/4000-17233/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

While West browses in a jewelry store, Allen spends some time, out on the street, taking pictures with his new camera. Allen is stunned to see his old childhood sweetheart, Daphne Dean, step before his lens. Allen is drawn away, from pursuing Dean, by West's screams, coming from the jewelry store. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Inside the jewelry store, the Flash confronts his old arch-nemesis, Heat Wave. Heat Wave's Hot Rod Distortion Beam disorients the Flash, causing him to stumble and fall. Heat Wave levels his weapon on the Flash.</p><p>Rather than getting up off the floor, the Flash rolls, at super-speed, into Heat Wave, rendering the fiery felon unconscious. Intent on getting back to Dean, the Flash doesn't wait around to be thanked. Dean, though, is long gone. Back at home, the Flash, as Allen, reminisces about Dean, with West. Dean's doctor calls on the Allens. Dean has recently suffered a bout of amnesia. As Dean has no family to speak of, it is the doctor's hope that her close relationship with Allen will aid in Dean regaining her memory. Allen readily agrees to spend time with Dean, though West seems a tinge jealous over the matter. The Allens' next-door neighbor, Barney Sands, watches Heat Wave's arrest on television.</p><p>Sands imagines a second encounter at the jewelry store, one wherein the Flash loses a fight with Sands' latest creation, Master Villain. Sands' older brother, Larry, enters the room, breaking Sands from his reverie. Sands shows his brother his latest illustration, a full figure study of Master Villain. Dean arrives at the Allens' home. Unbeknownst to dean, she does not arrive alone. An invisible, gaseous alien has traveled with her, seeking new experiences. The alien is drawn to Sands' powerful imagination. With Sands fast asleep at his drawing table, the alien infuses itself with the drawing of Master Villain. Sands awakens for dinner, never noticing that his Master Villain drawing is gone.</p><p>The Allens escort Dean around Central City. Suddenly, a trio of police officers goes hurtling through the air over their heads. Allen, moving faster than the eye can see, puts on his Flash costume, then vibrates down through the street, into the sewer. Having plotted the officers' trajectory, the Flash races along underground, before burrowing his way up into a nearby park. There, the Flash generates an air cushion, at super-human speed, to break the officers' fall. The officers inform the Flash that a new criminal, calling himself ""Master Villain"", is attacking police headquarters. Sands returns to his drawing board to discover the absence of his drawing. The Flash confronts Master Villain.</p><p>His new adversary opens by slamming his fists together, generating a massive thunderbolt. The Flash barely manages to dodge the lethal lighting strike. Master Villain leaps into the air, and literally stomps police headquarters flat. The Flash charges Master Villain, only to be possessed by his newest adversary. Master Villain forces the Flash to run, ever faster, in place, in an attempt to exhaust the Scarlet Speedster. The moment Master Villain relaxes his control, the Flash begins spinning like a top. Unable to cope with the dizzying effects brought on by the Flash's centrifugal force, Master Villain exits the Flash's body. With Master Villain still reeling, the Flash tries to put him out.</p><p>The Scarlet Speedster is so exhausted though, that his blow is incredibly feeble. Master Villain flees, leaving the Flash to puzzle over the criminal's childlike speech patterns. Dean places a phone call, and indicates that her scheme is going according to plan. Allen completely believes in her ""amnesia"". After hearing reports of the Flash's battle with Master Villain, Sands sits down at his drawing board, and begins to draw the only hero who could possibly bring Master Villain to justice.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Batman in ""<strong>The World's Upside Down</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,17312,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/15531-1995-17312-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",248,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]","""Challenge Of The Cardboard Criminal!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58440/', 'id': 58440, 'name': ""Heat Wave's Flamethrower"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heat-waves-flamethrower/4055-58440/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30117/', 'id': 30117, 'name': 'Frank Springer', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-springer/4040-30117/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-248-challenge-of-the-cardboard-criminal/4000-17312/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

It was in this manner that West learned that Allen was, secretly, the Flash. This night, all Allen speaks of is his old childhood sweetheart, the actress, Daphne Dean. A late night phone call interrupts West's eavesdropping, and awakens Allen. Master Villain calls Allen threatening to reveal his secret identity, if Allen doesn't meet him in the next five seconds, as the Flash. Allen bolts out of bed, puts on his costume, and races out to confront Master Villain. The Flash races into the pre-arranged meeting site, a phone booth. As soon as the Flash answers the incessantly ringing phone, Master Villain appear in the booth with him. Master Villain teleports out of the phone booth, then transforms it into one large, standing brick, which he shatters.</p><p>Moving faster than the eye could see, the Flash vibrated his molecules so that he could slip beneath the street, prior to the phone booth transformation. Coming up behind his foe, the Flash violently shoves Master Villain to the ground. Master Villain counterattacks with an energy fist. After knocking the Flash to the ground, the disembodied fist waits for the Flash to get up. The Flash flees, with the energy fist in hot pursuit. The Flash runs all the way to Metropolis, where he locates Superman, in his guise as Daily Planet reporter, Clark Kent. Vibrating his molecules into insubstantiality, the Flash runs right through Kent. Kent barely feels the impact of the energy fist. Kent merely gives pause, to mention a strange tickle at the back of his neck, to his companion, Daily Planet reporter, Lois Lane.</p><p>Back at home, the Flash, as Allen, fends off the amorous advances of Dean, while trying to help her regain her memory. Allen meets up with West, at the next-door neighbor's house, for an evening spent playing Bridge. Unbeknownst to Allen, Fred and Ethel Sands' youngest son, Barney, created Master Villain. Unbeknownst to Sands, an alien life form, drawn to and fueled by Sands' imagination, inhabited the drawing of Master Villain, and brought the character to life.The Allens return home. West is fuming as all Allen talked about the whole night is Dean. Upon seeing Dean sleeping on their couch, West's anger escalates. West is scolding Allen when she turns to see him wearing his Flash costume. Turning back, West sees Master Villain standing in her living room. The Flash attacks Master Villain only to have his super-speed momentum turned against him.</p><p>The Flash finds himself spinning like a propeller, generating hurricane force winds. West takes cover behind the couch. Astonsihingly, Dean sleeps through the entire battle. Master Villain hurls the Flash out the window. The Flash is spinning so fast that the shards of glass literally melt on impact, from his super-speed friction. By the time the Flash recovers, Master Villain is gone. The Flash hears Master Villain's voice coming from the Sands home, only to discover that it is actually Barney Sands' voice. Sands confesses that he created Master Villain. Sands has created an adversary to deal with Master Villain, called ""Super-Hero"". Unfortunately, Sands has been unable to get Super-Hero to come to life. Sands, though, is unaware that it was an alien life form that brought Master Villain into the real world.</p><p>Master Villain issues a challenge for the Flash to come fight him. The Flash arrives for their duel, dressed as Super-Hero. Masquerading as Super-Hero, the Flash begins beating a life size dummy of Master Villain. Master Villain feels every blow that ""Super-Hero"" lands on the dummy. ""Super-Hero"" begins spinning the dummy above his head, causing Master Villains to do the same. As the dummy falls to the ground, so, too, does Master Villain. The alien animating Master Villain abandons it's charade. The alien sought only an alleviation to it's great boredom.

Moments later, a fishing wire comes to hook the new gun away to the rooftops in which Cold follows as Flash is a bit freezer burned but not worse for wear.</p><p>Upon the roof, Cold threatens to blast the woman whom had hooked his new gun--which is indeed is very own sister, Golden Glider. Cold is confused why she didn't allow him to finish off the Flash once and for all, but its due to the fact that Glider wants Flash to suffer like she has due to the Death of her love, The Top in which was Flash's fault.</p><p>Trying to convince her that it won't do much against Flash, Gilder doesn't care for it will make her feel better and runs off to Top's grave and vows to avenge him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Barry Allen and a co-worker back at the lab study The Flash suit to see exactly what Captain Cold's Gun did to the fabric in which is based on the concept of 'Freeze-Drying'.

It takes a bit but Flash zips about the ice burg and melts. Captain Cold sees another opportunity to take out The Flash but is taken out by knockout gas but not before seeing who it was doing this to him.

Still trapped within a type of Energy top type force-field, Flash does some quick thinking and vibrates through and heads towards Iris with the intention to save her from the blast. At first, it looks like he was too late...</p><p>But Flash is and saves Iris by taking the blast. Iris is grateful to be rescue but notices that he isn't moving and goes to turn him over. Taking the full blunt of the blast for her, got him basically freeze-dried and not moving. During this, Golden Glider skates off while not believing how she missed for she had Iris RIGHT there in her sights--and hopes that he's alive for he has to suffer like she has.</p><p>Neighbors come about, not believing their eyes seeing the Flash there--also thinking he's a goner while Iris weeps. Being lead away from the body, the on-lookers are then shocked to see The Flash starting to becoming a type of blur on the ground. Somehow, he reconstructs and restores every atom in his body and stands. Iris, very happy but also stressed faints against a fellow neighbor. The Flash suggests he take her home so her husband can take care of her.</p><p>Getting home, Iris and Barry discuss over why Golden Glider would want to kill her and not him in which Barry says he has some ideas but no firm answers.</p><p>Somewhere within the city, Golden Glider is taking apart the gun to discover that it can only be programmed to a certain person's molecular structure at a time and goes to start re-programming it for a certain Iris Allen.</p><p>Around the same time within the State Penitentiary, Captain Cold is ranting in his cell over the fact his sister left him defenseless where the Flash could get him. Continuing on, he goes on about how She and the Flash better watch for him and after a final yell, tenses up and drops to the floor where a few moments later? He is confirmed dead and confuses the staff and the doctor for he stated the man was in perfect health.</p><p>Next Day, Barry and Iris are seen walking downtown, talking about the Rogues and how Golden Glider is different for she has a driven look that reminds him of Batman. He has two clues which are her Top Gimmicks and Captain Cold's gun and before he could continue, Barry turns to see Iris being abducted into a light ray that's connected to a Fly Top. Changing into Flash, he rushes after her to tackle Iris from the beam and lands with her safely to the ground. Having thought to himself during this whole situation, He's convinced that this all must connect to The Top--but why is Golden Glider apart of it as well?</p><p>While asking Iris to speak to him, She does speak but as Golden Glider speaking through her, saying how she knows this woman is his love and that she will not last much longer for he ended The Top's life thus bringing it down to 'A love for a love!'</p><p>Later that day, Barry goes though the official files of Roscoe 'The Top' Dillon in which there is no record of him having a lover but series of events that connects her to him as well as Captain Cold to her also. His research is disrupted as he gets a call from Daphne (for he promised to see her plane off). Covering his mouth, he pretends that he's a fellow co-worker and then zips over to be right beside her. Daphne and Barry talk and he ask a Favor (that would clear her name in the eyes of He and Iris) in which she takes him up on it.</p><p>That night within the Central City Morgue, Two guards are playing cards and a certain drawer with a body within starts to ice over. The drawer slams out upon the floor with the iced over body in which an 'ice-man' slowly starts to stand. It shoots at the Two men with an ice blast and knocks them out. The ice man starts melting to reveal its Len Snart, having learned to go into a Sub-zero Metabolic Trance to simulate Death. Taking one of the man's clothes, he sneaks out to go get his Captain Cold gear on and 'settle some debts with his darling sister and the Flash.'</p><p>A new day, and Barry received tickets to see an ice show that night but he's certain its a trap. Figuring out the connection between Top, Golden Glider and Captain Cold, He decides to go to this show and bringing Iris as well. At the Central City Palace, Lisa Star takes the ice with her baton as Barry and Iris watch from front row box seats. The ice skater tosses her baton into the air, catches, aims and shoots Iris. She falls and its known that Lisa Star is Golden Glider. But, 'Iris' doesn't parish for it wasn't Iris at all, It was Daphne looking like Iris thus the cold gun technology wouldn't work on her.</p><p>On ice skates, The Flash goes out to take on Golden Glider but she goes to take to her air and skate. Almost away, Captain Cold comes to the scene to trap her. She gets free and it turns into a slight sibling battle on ice. Grabbing the tail of his hood, Glider drags Cold about the ice while all forgetting about The Flash. Taking this opportunity, He zips about the siblings to spray ice over them continuously. After a few more moments, The siblings are now trapped within ice, Daphne takes off her Iris disguise and the crowd goes wild due to the show they witness--wanting an encore.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Batman &amp; Robin in ""<strong>Birds of a Feather</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,17561,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/15756-1995-17561-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",251,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Vengeance On Ice!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57075/', 'id': 57075, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Skates"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-skates/4055-57075/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58441/', 'id': 58441, 'name': ""Top's Trick Tops"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tops-trick-tops/4055-58441/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-12277/', 'id': 12277, 'name': 'Jack Abel', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-abel/4040-12277/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-37185/', 'id': 37185, 'name': 'Jack Adler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-adler/4040-37185/', 'role': 'production'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-251-vengeance-on-ice/4000-17561/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Sue is surprised in her hotel room by a menacing stranger. Sue forcibly throws the man to the floor, only to discover that it is Dibny, in disguise. Dibny remolds his facial features back to his normal visage. Dibny has decided that his best chance of apprehending the Chane Gang is by going undercover. The Dibnys are just finished drinking a toast, when Ralph disappears. Sue immediately contacts police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, and his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, for aid in locating her husband.</p><p>The Allens reassure Sue that her husband will be found. As soon as Sue departs, Allen reveals that, as the Flash, he spirited Dibny out of the hotel room, moving so fast as to be naked to the human eye. The Flash had spotted the Chane Gang in the midst of a robbery, and figured that Dibny would want in on the takedown, in his guise as the Elongated Man. The Flash singled out one of the four Chane Gang members and surrounded him in a super-speed generated updraft. Astonishingly, the crook ran right through the Flash. The Elongated Man, too, found that he couldn't lay a glove on a single member of the Chane Gang.</p><p>Realizing they were actually fighting holograms, and that the Chane ""Gang"" is just one man, the Elongated Man stretched his neck high enough to get a bird's eye view of the surrounding streets. Spying the real culprit, the Elongated Man directed the Flash to the fleeing crook. After apprehending the man, the Flash revealed the holographic hardware laced into his jacket. Upon returning to the First Central Bank, the two heroes discovered they'd only recovered half of the stolen money. The Elongated Man headed off to solve the case, and that was the last the Flash saw of him. The Flash scours the streets of Central City looking for the Elongated Man.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the Flash, the Elongated Man has altered his features, and is thus unrecognizable. Going undercover, the Elongated Man makes contact with the twin brother of the man they arrested earlier. It turns out the Chane Gang is really a two man operation. Having determined that the brother has the missing half of the money, the Elongated Man strong-arms the crook into partnering with him. The Flash reports in to Sue before returning home. On the television, Sue sees Dibny, in his disguise, at the airport. A multi-million dollar SST is being unveiled to the public. To the amazement of the crowd of onlookers, the plane suddenly melts into a massive puddle of goo.</p><p>Having also seen the spectacle on television, Allen investigates, as the Flash. Impressed by what he's seen, the Chane brother agrees to a criminal partnership with Dibny. When the Flash arrives to investigate the jet, the Chane brother asks for another demonstration of Dibny's incredible power. Dibny walks up to the Flash and boldly takes credit for destroying the jet. Dibny, now calling himself ""The Molder"", openly challenges the Flash. The Flash charges ""The Molder"". With a single touch, ""The Molder"" transforms the entire runway into liquified tar.</p><p>The Flash spins his way free, and momentarily lays ""The Molder"" out with a single blow. While ""The Molder"" is stunned, the Flash watches as his facial features briefly become Dibny's again. Startled to discover that his newest foe is really his best friend, the Flash is caught flatfooted by ""The Molder"". With the television camera crews still filming, ""The Molder"" distorts the Flash's body like taffy, before pounding the Scarlet Speedster into a horrific blob of fleshy putty.</p>",,,,,,,False,17645,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/15833-1995-17645-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",252,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""Double Dose Of Danger!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55822/', 'id': 55822, 'name': 'Gingold', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gingold/4055-55822/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': ''}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-12277/', 'id': 12277, 'name': 'Jack Abel', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-abel/4040-12277/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-252-double-dose-of-danger/4000-17645/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Having easily done away with the Flash, the Molder reconsiders the need for a partner, leaving his associate waist deep in the liquified tar of the runway. Picture News reporter, Iris West, races to the crime scene, arriving just in time to see the Flash's remains loaded into an ambulance. The Molder takes refuge in an abandoned junkyard. While asleep, his mind plays back the recent events of his life. As Ralph Dibny, the world famous Elongated Man, the Molder had come to Central City to bring the Chane Gang to justice.</p><p>Dibny had surprised his wife, Sue, in their hotel room, by remolding the features of his face into a more sinister visage. Having discovered the Chane Gang in the midst of a robbery, the Flash came to the Dibny's hotel room, to collect the Elongated Man. After downing a double dose of gingold, the Elongated Man teamed up with the Flash to take down the Chane Gang. West puts together a memorial tribute reel for the Flash, to be aired later that night. West meets up with Sue Dibny for lunch. There, Dibny reveals that the Molder is really her husband, Ralph. Unbeknownst to the the two women, their conversation is being eavesdropped upon, by an agent of a foreign power.</p><p>Out on the street, West suddenly has an epiphany, and races to police headquarters. With the officers on duty drawn away by West's memorial tribute to the Flash, West sneaks into the police morgue. Noticing that part of the Flash's remains had pooled into the shape of a lightning bolt, West surmises that electricity might rejuvenate the Flash. Using a defibrillator, West runs current through the Flash's remains. The resultant explosion knocks West through the window. Before she can fall to the street, she is rescued by the Flash. Back at home, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, shares a happy reunion, and a memorable night with his wife, West.</p><p>The next morning, the Flash holds a press conference, then races to Mexico. The Flash had determined that the gingold Dibny consumed, en route to the Chane Gang robbery, was, somehow, contaminated by the Flash's super-speed vibrations. The tainted gingold in Dibny's bloodstream created the Molder personality, as well as the alteration to Dibny's powers. In Mexico, the Flash collects a deadly fungus, lethal to the Gingo Tree, from which Gingold is distilled. Isolating the fungus in a hypodermic solution, the Flash believes he may have a cure for Dibny's condition. West immediately phones Sue Dibny to give her the good news.</p><p>Dibny, however, is being held hostage by agents of a foreign power. These men are using Dibny as leverage to manipulate the Molder. When Dibny doesn't respond to West's call, Allen investigates, as the Flash. Arriving at Dibny's hotel room, the Flash easily subdues her captor. Security guards are gassed, at the Central City Rotunda. The Molder transforms an entire mural, by Communist defector, Ivor Dunwich, into liquified plastic. The foreign agents collect the remains of the mural, having made their example of the traitorous Dunwich. The Flash arrives, only to have the Molder bring the ceiling down upon him, in a rain of  liquified goo. The foreign agents fire on the Flash.</p><p>Vibrating his molecules at super-human speed, the Flash becomes insubstantial, passing through the liquid shell of the ceiling, as well as the bullets, without harm. The Molder suddenly remembers that he is, in fact, Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man. The Flash and the Elongated Man team up to take down the foreign agents. The Flash reveals that it was a false mural that the Molder destroyed. The true mural is undamaged. Upon arriving on the scene, the Flash immediately hit the Molder with the fungal antidote. The Elongated Man wonders why he didn't lose his stretching power, when the antidote neutralized the Gingold in his system. As if on cue, he loses his ability to elongate. The antidote merely took a little longer in completely erasing his gingold derived powers.</p>",,,,,,,False,17738,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/15917-1995-17738-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",253,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55820/', 'id': 55820, 'name': 'Mexico', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mexico/4020-55820/'}]","""Don't Mess With The Molder!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55822/', 'id': 55822, 'name': 'Gingold', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gingold/4055-55822/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-12277/', 'id': 12277, 'name': 'Jack Abel', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-abel/4040-12277/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-253-don-t-mess-with-the-molder/4000-17738/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

As the Flash makes his way back up the building, to return the girl, and her cat, home, he sees the Mirror Master, standing in the window of a lower apartment. After returning the girl to her mother, the Flash races back down the building, then creates a powerful sucking vacuum, at super-human speed, to draw the Mirror Master out. Instead of the Mirror Master, an old man, still in bed, is pulled out of his window. Realizing the Mirror Master was merely a reflection, the Flash returns his hapless victim, along with his belongings, back into the apartment.</p><p>Spying the Mirror Master on the street, the Flash gives chase. Incredibly, the image of the Mirror Master is able to stay ahead of the Flash. The Flash is led to an abandoned windmill, where he finds not only the Mirror Master waiting for him, but Captain Cold, the Pied Piper, the Trickster, and the Weather Wizard, as well. The Flash's Rogues' Gallery begin applauding the Scarlet Speedster. Before the Flash can react, he is frozen in place by Captain Cold. The Pied PIper hands the Flash an honorary Roscoe Award, named after the Flash's deceased enemy Roscoe Dillon, infamously known as<a href=""/top/4005-24698/"" data-ref-id=""4005-24698""> the Top.</a> The Rogues are awarding the Flash for forcing them to become greater villains.</p><p>The Flash finally gets his molecules moving, then collapses the windmill with a super-speed generated hurricane. When the debris cloud clears, however, the Rogues are nowhere to be found. Returning home, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is surprised to see that his houseguest, Stacy Conwell, has returned from her studies abroad, in Europe. Allen is even more surprised to see Conwell practicing black magic rituals, in her bedroom. Hearing the sounds of his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, coming home, Allen races to intercept her, before she sees what Conwell is doing. After greeting his wife, Allen's attention is drawn to the television newscast.</p><p>The evening news gives a different account of the little girl's earlier rescue, one which doesn't indicate any involvement at all by the Flash. Allen is too outraged to notice West and Conwell's reunion. Suddenly, Allen feels himself being drawn beneath the surface of the Earth, to a deep underground cavern. There, he is confronted by Mazdan, an old enemy, from the future. Allen, as the Flash, brings the cavern crumbling down around Mazdan, before spinning his opponent at incredible velocity. Mazdan, though, reveals that Allen is still in his kitchen, and that their entire encounter is merely an illusion projected directly into Allen's mind.</p><p>Allen points out his Roscoe Award, sitting on the kitchen counter, to West and Conwell, but neither woman sees anything. Allen retires to the couch, left wondering how to determine between reality and Mazdan's illusions. Allen is torn from his reverie by the alarm from his <a href=""/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/"" data-ref-id=""4060-31815"">Justice League of America</a> signal device. Answering the call, the Flash encounters the Trickster, apparently in the midst of digging up hidden loot. The Trickster attempts to flee, with a rocket-propelled shovel, but the Flash brings him down with a super-speed generated dirt-tornado. The Flash carries the Trickster along with him, to his rendezvous with the Justice League of America.</p><p>The Flash meets up with Aquaman and Hawkman. The two heroes join hands with the Flash, then begin singing and dancing. As they cavort around, Hawkman becomes a dancing hawk and Aquaman, a dancing fish. The Flash realizes the whole scenario has been another of Mazdan's illusions. With no way to determine truth from fiction, the Flash falls to his knees, utterly defeated. The Trickster arrives at the abandoned Ajax Warehouse, to report his encounter with the Flash. The Rogues used the Mirror Master's teleport-lens to escape the windmill. The Trickster reveals that it isn't the Roscoe Award that is driving the Flash insane, though it is true that only the Flash can see it. Realizing their arch-nemesis is at an extreme disadvantage, the Rogues gear up to take their scheme to the next level.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Wonder Woman in ""<b>Cooky La Moo on Broadway</b>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,17833,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16006-1995-17833-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",254,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""To Believe Or Not To Believe!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58442/', 'id': 58442, 'name': ""Trickster's Gadgets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tricksters-gadgets/4055-58442/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57175/', 'id': 57175, 'name': ""Weather Wizard's Wand"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/weather-wizards-wand/4055-57175/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33927/', 'id': 33927, 'name': 'Dick Dillin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-dillin/4040-33927/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-1669/', 'id': 1669, 'name': 'Joe Rubinstein', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-rubinstein/4040-1669/', 'role': 'cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-254-to-believe-or-not-to-believe/4000-17833/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The Flash rushes Conwell to safety, then tackles the demons. After the threat is vanquished, the Flash resumes his civilian identity, that of Barry Allen, a police forensics scientist. Allen tends to Conwell, who finds Allen's behavior towards her puzzling. Conwell was not, in fact, practicing black magic in her bedroom. In actuality, she was practicing a baton routine. Conwell proves it to Allen by showing him photographs of her routine. The photographic evidence shakes Allen from his delusion.</p><p>Mazdan appears before Allen. Once again, the felon from the future is merely an illusion in Allen's mind. Mazdan gloats over his triumph of Allen, having completely broken down Allen's ability to tell truth from fiction. Allen decides to turn to the one person in all the world he implicitly trusts, his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West. Allen catches up with West at the Picture News building. West is going over the footage from the previous nights gala film opening. An event crashed by the notorious Mirror Master.</p><p>After divesting all the patrons of their jewelry, the Mirror Master's special weapons liquified the gemstones, then absorbed them. The Mirror Master fled by riding the spotlight into the sky. The Flash, however, rapidly caught up with the Mirror Master, and knocked him out of the beam. After dropping the Mirror Master into a lake, the Flash violently whipped up the waters. By the time the Mirror Master reached the shore, all of his hidden mirror weapons have been removed from his person. The Flash, however, hasn't counted on the Mirror Master's secret weapon.</p><p>A blazing insignia appeared on the Mirror Master's chest, one that resembled the Roscoe Award, bestowed upon the Flash by his Rogues' Gallery. Upon seeing the insignia, the Flash was compelled to backtrack his actions, in reverse, all the way back to his car. The Flash resumed his civilian identity, just as an officer was preparing to tow his car away. Allen confides all these details to West, then rushes her home. Allen shows West the Roscoe Award. West had been unable to perceive the Roscoe Award prior, leading Allen to believe it to be another of Mazdan's illusions.</p><p>After discovering the Mirror Master's cloaking technology on the award, Allen was able to disable it, and prove it's existence to West. Allen now knows that the Roscoe Award serves as a post hypnotic trigger, forcing him to reverse all actions whenever one of the Rogues flashes the insignia at him. Allen has already come up with a counter against the Rogue's new failsafe against him. Aware of the Mirror Master's modus operandi, Allen, as the Flash, catches up with him, as he tries to fence the stolen jewels. The Flash hurls the Mirror Master to the ground.</p><p>As soon as the Mirror Master flashes the insignia, the Flash finds himself racing, backwards, back out of the room. Out on the street, the Flash once again attacks the Mirror Master, elevating him in a super-speed generated whirlwind. The MIrror Master, once again, flashes the insignia, this time to no effect. Wearing special mirrored contact lenses, the Flash perceives the world backwards. Seeing the reverse image of the insignia did not trigger the Rogues' post-hypnotic spell. After beating the living daylights out of the Mirror Master, the Flash dons the MIrror Master's costume. The Flash intends to infiltrate the Rogues' Gallery's secret headquarters and settle the score with his old enemies.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Wonder Woman in ""<strong>Cooky La Moo on Broadway</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,17925,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16088-1995-17925-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",255,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""Flashback To Danger!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58436/', 'id': 58436, 'name': 'Mirror Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-gun/4055-58436/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-12277/', 'id': 12277, 'name': 'Jack Abel', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-abel/4040-12277/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-255-flashback-to-danger/4000-17925/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Before the two felons can escape with their fallen comrade, they are stopped by the police. One of the officers activates the police siren to signal for backup. The Pied Piper usurps control of the siren, amplifying it's sound, then converting it into a sonic attack that fells the police officers. The Weather Wizard summons a tornado, which the three Rogues ride back to their secret lair. After some minor squabbling, between the Rogues, over who should have been placed on the search detail for the Mirror Master, the Trickster sees to their fallen comrade. Pulling back the Mirror Master's cowl reveal the masked countenance of the Flash.</p><p>The Rogues immediately bring their respective weapons to bear, but the Flash easily dodges them all. Racing in a circle around the Rogues, the Flash leaves after-images of himself to draw the Rogues' fire. While the Rogues fire on ghosts, the Flash moves in behind them and beats them all into unconsciousness. Just before the Flash hauls the Rogues off to jail, the Top appears, to taunt the Flash. The Flash is quick to attack, but the Top simply disappears. The Flash is startled by this turn of events, as the Top has been dead for several months. The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, picks up his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, for dinner. West is surprised to see Allen, as she was unaware they had dinner reservations that night.</p><p>West is even more surprised to see that Allen is sporting a crew cut, the hairstyle he had when they were dating. Even more puzzling , after dinner, Allen walks West back to her old apartment. West realizes that Allen has no memory of their marriage, and believes that they are still dating. Uncertain as to the cause of his memory loss, West plays along with Allen's delusion. West ends up taking a cab ride to her home. Allen heads to his laboratory, at police headquarters, where he is accosted by the Top. Revealing that he knows Allen is the Flash, the Top challenges his old foe to a duel. Allen, as the Flash, charges the Top, who alters his molecular structure into that of a man-sized Top. The Flash runs ever faster around the spinning Top, causing it to unravel.</p><p>The molecular energy spirals out, reconfiguring itself back into the Top's normal, human form. The Flash tries to grab the Top, only to suffer a powerful electric shock, that floors him. West sees an interview with the Flash, that occurred immediately after the fight. In the interview, the Flash clearly has no knowledge of the Top's death, a fact that troubles West. Mazdan, one of the Flash's early enemies, appears in West's living room. Imprisoning West in an energy cage, Mazdan reveals that he has erased the Flash's memories an equal number of years as Mazdan was incarcerated. The Golden Glider, having also seen the interview, sets out to discover who is impersonating her deceased lover. The Top attacks Allen on the street. Allen, as the Flash, defends himself.</p><p>The Top, anticipating the Flash's tactics, counters by releasing concealed streamers that bind the Flash. Vibrating his molecules at super-human speed, the Flash becomes insubstantial and passes down through the street, escaping from his bindings. The Top brings a new weapon to bear, only to have it snatched from his grasp. The Flash comes up behind the Top, and beats him down. Having defeated his enemy, the Flash reveals that he knows the ""Top"" is really Mazdan. The electric shock the Flash received, in their prior encounter, restored the Flash's memory. Unbeknownst to Mazdan, it was not the Flash who disarmed him, but the Golden Glider. As the Flash escorts Mazdan away, the Golden Glider watches from afar, plotting her next revenge scheme against the Flash.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess

Unbeknownst to the happy couple, they are being shadowed by the Golden Glider. A tree falls in front of their car. A second tree topples towards their car. Allen vibrates the molecules of himself, West, and the entire car, into intangibility, allowing the tree to pass harmlessly through them. Allen and West investigate, and discover that the trees have been burned through with a laser. Realizing that they're probably under observation, Allen and West slowly return to their car, and resume their journey.</p><p>Having seen Allen's display of super-human speed, the Golden Glider confirms that Allen is, in fact, the Flash. Allen and West try to put their troubles aside, while visiting with Allen's parents, Henry and Nora. That night, a large, glowing diamond appears in Allen's bedroom. While Allen, as the Flash, follows the diamond into the woods, West makes excuses for his absence to his parents. The Flash trails the diamond to the Golden Glider, who reveals she knows his secret identity. The Flash charges the Golden Glider, only to find his mass increased a thousandfold, by her ruby. The Flash sinks deep into the ground, until he has sank deep enough to escape the ruby's power.</p><p>Returning to the surface, the Flash collapses from the sudden shifts in his mass. An opal, left by the Golden Glider, fills the Flash's mind with images of his parents, who have suddenly been stricken with a terrible malady. Upon revival, the Flash shakes the images off as nothing but a dream. Upon returning to his parent's home, however, he finds medical personal standing out in the yard. The Flash, as Allen, confronts his parents, and confirms his worst fears. They are sick, as is Allen's wife. The Golden Glider appears in a holographic prism, to taunt Allen, and inform him that an impenetrable force field surrounds the house, keeping the medics at bay.</p><p>Allen can come and go as he pleases, but no one else can get in or out. Allen's parents, and his wife, slip into a coma. Allen, as the Flash, heads back into the woods to confront the Golden Glider. Flushing her out, the Flash races at super-speed, creating a downdraft of compressed air, to draw her to the ground. The Golden Glider bombards the Flash with rapidly expanding pearls. After dispatching the threat of the pearls, the Flash rams the Golden Glider off her ice-trail. Taking ahold of her, the Flash races the Golden Glider straight towards the force field, in an attempt to force her to reverse the Allen's condition. The Golden Glider calls the Flash's bluff.</p><p>At the last moment, the Flash casts the Golden Glider aside. Realizing the Golden Glider's weapons are all designed with a jewel-motif, the Flash removes all the jewelry from his parent's house. Nothing changes in his parent's, or West's condition. The Flash spies jewels encrusting West's initials on her suitcase. The Flash sets the molecules of the suitcase vibrating so violently that it disintegrates. West, and Allen's parents, immediately recover. Allen, though, finds a scrap of cloth, left by the Golden Glider, warning of her next appearance.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, The Penguin in ""<strong>The Cuckoo Cuckoos</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,18132,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16265-1995-18132-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",257,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-66361/', 'id': 66361, 'name': 'Fallville', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fallville/4020-66361/'}]",The Golden Glider's Triple Play,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60268/', 'id': 60268, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Jewels"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-jewels/4055-60268/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57075/', 'id': 57075, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Skates"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-skates/4055-57075/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3259/', 'id': 3259, 'name': 'Al Milgrom', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/al-milgrom/4040-3259/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-12277/', 'id': 12277, 'name': 'Jack Abel', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-abel/4040-12277/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33720/', 'id': 33720, 'name': 'Milt Snapinn', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/milt-snapinn/4040-33720/', 'role': 'letterer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-257-the-golden-glider-s-triple-play/4000-18132/,1977-10-04,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

An enormous meteor was on a collision course for Coast City. As the panicked citizens looked skyward, two gigantic hands, composed of green energy, caught and crushed the meteor. The Green Lantern had saved the city. A large meteor fragment fell towards Coast Park. This, too, was intercepted by the Green Lantern, then melted down. The Green Lantern was just about to blast the rock into dust, when a local artist convinced him to donate it to the Coast City Museum. The curator leads several of the museum patrons to the next exhibit. One man, William Hand, breaks off from the larger group, lingering by the meteor fragment.</p><p>Hand absorbs the residual power ring energy from the meteor, then heads to Central City. The Flash is presented with a bronze insignia plaque, by the mayor of Central City. Among the crowd of onlookers are Lisa Snart, the infamous Golden Glider, and the Sands family, next door neighbors of police forensic scientist, Barry Allen. Young Barney Sands furiously snaps photograph after photograph of the award ceremony. The Green Lantern arrives. Upon shaking the Flash's hand, the Green Lantern causes the Flash's invisible protective aura to appear around the Scarlet Speedster. This results in the Flash feeling a momentary wave of weakness, that brings him to his knees. While the Flash is down, the Green Lantern kicks him off the stage, and into oncoming traffic.</p><p>Vibrating his molecules at super-human speed, the Flash becomes insubstantial, allowing a tractor trailer to pass harmlessly through him. The ""Green Lantern"" reveals himself to be Black Hand, one of the Green Lantern's rogues gallery. Greatly recovered, the Flash attacks Black Hand, flooring him with a single punch. Black Hand uses the residual power ring energy, collected at the Coast City Museum, to levitate the entire stage into the air, before transforming it into an attack craft. Black Hand rolls the attack craft, pitching the Flash off the hood. As the Flash falls, Black Hand fires on him, with beams of power ring energy. Astonishingly, the Flash is able to race along the beams, even controlling their direction, through his super-speed vibrations.</p><p>The Flash redirects the beams back at Black Hand, destroying his ship. Before impact, Black Hand vanishes. Back at home, Sands is disappointed to find that all of his photographs of the Flash are blurry. The Flash, as Allen, has also returned home. Allen absentmindedly mows his lawn, while he ponders why Black Hand has come to Central City. Black Hand reveals that the moment he illuminated the Flash's invisible, protective aura on stage, his weapon locked onto it, and Black Hand has been remotely absorbing it ever since. Without his protective aura to protect him from the enormous heat friction generated by running at super-human speed, the Flash runs the risk of catching fire and burning to death. Sands tries to do some drawings of the Flash.</p><p>Sands asks Allen to model some running poses for him. Allen spies an enormous, gaseous black hand rising up over Central City. Allen investigates, as the Flash. The Flash is decked by a power-ring energy constructed fist. The Flash is then lifted, high into the air, by a power-ring constructed geyser. Running in place, at super-human speed, the Flash works his back down to the street, through the geyser. The Flash scours Central City, searching for Black Hand. The Flash begins heating up. Sweating profusely, the Flash realizes that he has lost his protective aura. The Flash tries to slow down, but it's too late. The Flash bursts into flames. By the time the Flash stops, all that remains of him is a smoldering pair of yellow boots, at the end of a miles long, still burning, scorch mark in the road. With the Flash dead, Black Hand prepares to enact the next part of his sinister scheme.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad ""<strong>Batman and Sable Lady</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,18212,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16338-1995-18212-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",258,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-47879/', 'id': 47879, 'name': 'Coast City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/coast-city/4020-47879/'}]","""The Day Flash Ran His Last Mile!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55705/', 'id': 55705, 'name': 'Cosmic Divining Rod', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-divining-rod/4055-55705/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41361/', 'id': 41361, 'name': 'Green Power Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-power-ring/4055-41361/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-12277/', 'id': 12277, 'name': 'Jack Abel', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-abel/4040-12277/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33720/', 'id': 33720, 'name': 'Milt Snapinn', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/milt-snapinn/4040-33720/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-258-the-day-flash-ran-his-last-mile/4000-18212/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Police officers, on the scene, find the Flash's still smoldering yellow boots, at the end of a mile long scorch mark, which is still afire. Black Hand is puzzled that the top story, on the evening news, does not concern the Flash's horrific demise. There is also no mention of it in the newspaper. The only possibility for such a telling omission is that the Flash is, somehow, still alive. Black Hand had stolen the Flash's protective aura, which kept the Flash from bursting into flame due to super-speed generated heat friction. As Black Hand's power-light absorbed the last of the Flash's protective aura, the Scarlet Speedster was consumed in flames.</p><p>Too late to slow down, the Flash vibrated his molecules to insubstantiality, while also activating the compression trigger in his Flash costume ring. The Flash was absorbed into his ring. A stray cat accidentally activates the release trigger, releasing the Flash from his ring. Moving at a much slower pace, though still super-humanly fast, the Flash headed home. Donning a new uniform, the Flash informed the police that he was, in fact, still very much alive. Back at home, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, updates his wife, PIcture News reporter Iris West, on the current situation. By combining the fortified molecules of the Flash's protective aura, with the energy beam of the Green Lantern's power ring, Black Hand sheathes himself within an impenetrable force field.</p><p>To test his new invincibility, Black Hand heads out to a nuclear bomb test site, in Nevada, and stands at ground zero of a nuclear explosion. Allen offers to drive his next-door neighbor, Barney Sands, out on some errands. While they're out, they pass by the Centro-Dome, which a movie crew has rented out to recreate a section of the moon, for filming. For the sake of authenticity, they've even sealed the Centro-Dome, then pumped all the air out. Allen receives word, from a radio bulletin, that an unidentified flying object is robbing a bank. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Taking care not to run so fast he'll burst into flame, the Flash arrives on the scene. A power-light constructed flying saucer is vacuuming up the bank's money, right through the bank's roof.</p><p>Black Hand reveals himself. The Flash is quick to attack, but his super-speed blows are completely ineffectual against Black Hand's force field. Worse, the Flash's hands begin smoking as he presses his attack. Black Hand counters with a dozen power-light constructed fists, that mercilessly pummel the Flash. Vibrating his molecules into intangibility, the Flash attempts to flee through the ground. Black Hand stops the Flash, with a power-light constructed grapple hook. Black Hand offers the Flash a choice of dooms. An instant death from a power-light laser, or the slow burn of super-speed generated friction heat. Seemingly choosing the latter, the Flash takes off running. Black Hand pursues, following the Flash into the Centro-Dome.</p><p>Inside of his force field, Black Hand is unaware of the airless void within the dome. The Flash, though, is quite aware of it. No air means no friction-heat. Black Hand projects power-light holograms of himself, to fool the Flash into attacking the wrong ""Black Hand"". Black Hand is surprised that the Flash's super-speed exertions have yet to incinerate him. Black Hand fires a power-light constructed heat seeking missile at the Flash. The Flash runs straight at Black Hand, vibrating through him, so that the missile strikes Black Hand. As the missile is composed of the same energy as Black Hand's force field, it easily penetrates the shield, rendering Black Hand unconscious. The Flash uses Black Hand's power-light to restore his protective aura.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad ""<strong>Batman and Sable Lady</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,18293,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16413-1995-18293-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",259,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55779/', 'id': 55779, 'name': 'Nevada', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nevada/4020-55779/'}]",Black Hand--The Kill-Proof Criminal!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55705/', 'id': 55705, 'name': 'Cosmic Divining Rod', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-divining-rod/4055-55705/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4322/', 'id': 4322, 'name': 'Bob McLeod', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bob-mcleod/4040-4322/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33720/', 'id': 33720, 'name': 'Milt Snapinn', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/milt-snapinn/4040-33720/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-259-black-hand-the-kill-proof-criminal/4000-18293/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Exactly one century ago, in the year 1978, Russell's ancestor, Philip, as the costumed criminal, the Viper, battled the Flash. An event that would seem to be impossible, as Philip's obituary had been posted that morning. Stranger still, Philip's wedding, to Cynthia Ross, occurred that evening. As luck would have it, Russell's daughter, Picture News reporter, Iris West, was visiting from the 20th Century, with her husband, who happens to be the Flash.</p><p>Russell proposes a visit to West's era, with his wife, Fran. The Flash agrees, and draws West and the Russells back to the 20th Century. En route, Russell thinks back to the day he sent his infant daughter, West, back in time, to save her from nuclear annihilation, to be raised by Professor Ira West. The time traveling party arrives to find burglars in the house. The Flash quickly grabs the thieves in his slipstream, and runs them over to police headquarters. West takes her mother on a shopping spree. The Flash, as police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, makes plans to spend the day with his father-in-law.</p><p>Russell, though, has other plans. While Allen is gathering more era-appropriate garments for his father-in-law, Russell teleports to San Francisco. Activating his uniform's invisibility aura, Russel begins his investigation into his ancestor's strange past. Moving at super-human speed, Allen, as the Flash, attunes his vibratory energy to the same frequency as Russell's teleporter, tracking him to San Francisco. Russell visits the morgue, only to find that Philip's body has disappeared. Russell's investigation carries him to Philip's office, where he works as a private investigator.</p><p>Philip's last casebook entry strongly suggests he murdered his arch-nemesis, the Viper. Arriving in San Francisco, the Flash is drawn to a robbery in progress, perpetrated by the Viper. The Flash confronts the Viper, easily dodging his opening attack. To protect the innocent bystanders behind him, the Flash uses a slab of sidewalk to block the Viper's acidic blast. The Viper switches tactics, attempting to gas the Flash. The Flash windmills the toxic vapors back at the Viper. The Viper feigns distress, in order to get close enough to expose the Flash to his paralytic toxin.</p><p>Russell discovers the Viper's journals in Philip's office, along with a large sum of stolen money and gems. Russell confirms that Philip is the Viper. His ancestor suffers from a split personality. References in the casebook to destroying the Viper indicate that Philip thought he had suppressed his Viper identity forever. The Viper side of his personality, however, willed Philip into a deathlike coma, allowing the Viper personality to become dominant. The man that walked out of the morgue was not Philip Russell. It was the Viper. The Viper drops the paralyzed body of the Flash off a cliff, and into the ocean.</p><p>The Flash shakes off the paralysis. Moving at super-human speed, the Flash generates a waterspout, that he rides back up the cliff face. Seconds later, the Flash has beaten the Viper into unconsciousness. Russell arrives, and fills the Flash in on his findings. Using 20th century materials, the Flash helps Russell cobble together a ""Psycho-Healer"". Russell uses the device to remove the Viper personality from Philip. The Flash returns all of the Viper's ill-gotton gains, leaving Philip to keep his appointment at the church. The Flash rushes Russell home, arriving just ahead of West, and her mother.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Superman in ""<strong>The Big Fall</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,18374,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16487-1995-18374-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",260,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55716/', 'id': 55716, 'name': 'California', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/california/4020-55716/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55704/', 'id': 55704, 'name': 'San Francisco', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/san-francisco/4020-55704/'}]","""The 1000 Year-Old Root!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42253/', 'id': 42253, 'name': 'José Luis García-López', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jose-luis-garcia-lopez/4040-42253/', 'role': 'artist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-260-the-1000-year-old-root/4000-18374/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The caller is actually the Golden Glider, who Allen has, somehow not noticed is calling from the adjacent pay phone. The Golden Glider taunts Allen with her knowledge if his secret identity. Knowing that he won't jeopardize his secret identity, on the street, in broad daylight, the Golden Glider blasts Allen. Allen rides the momentum generated by the Golden Glider's blast, through a hedge wall, where he dons his costume.</p><p>The Flash races to engage the Golden Glider, only to be blasted from above. While the Flash is dazed, the Golden Glider slips a pair of special ice-skates on his feet. Attempting to run, the Flash is carried into the air by the skates. Latching onto a building spire, the Flash spins around, at high velocity, until the skates are torn from his feet by centrifugal force. The Flash leaps down to the Golden Glider's ice-trail, in pursuit of his adversary. The Flash is just about to catch the Golden Glider, when an errantly thrown frisbee strikes him.</p><p>At the velocity the Flash was moving, the frisbee is able to knock him from the ice-trail, casting him down to the ground. The Golden Glider skates away to freedom. Returning home in a heavily soiled uniform, the Flash's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, is none to thrilled that her husband has ruined their couch, by sitting down on it in his filthy costume. The Flash, as Allen, awakes the next morning to a note from his wife. West has gone into work early, to conduct an interview with Central City's newest defender, the Ringmaster. Allen has never heard of the Ringmaster.</p><p>At police headquarters, Allen is surprised to see the Golden Glider in custody, apparently brought in by the Ringmaster. Allen, along with several other officers, watch a film reel of the Ringmaster's battle against the Golden Glider. Allen is somewhat perturbed over his fellow officers fawning admiration of the Ringmaster, seemingly dismissing all Allen has done for Central City, in his guise, as the Flash. Allen arrives for his lunch date with West, only to learn that she is, at that very moment, interviewing the Ringmaster. West asks the Ringmaster for a demonstration of his amazing rings.</p><p>The Ringmaster pelts West with four rings, knocking her off the rooftop. Seeing his wife falling to her death, Allen responds as the Flash. The rings, though, enlarge and lock around West's wrists and ankles, levitating her back up to the roof. The Flash reaches the rooftop just in time to see West walk off with the Ringmaster. The Flash clearly sees the Ringmaster make a play for West. In her cell, the Golden Glider contemplates her current scheme to drive the Flash and West apart, with her pawn, the Ringmaster.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Wonder Woman in ""<strong>Dilemma</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,18463,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16568-1995-18463-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",261,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""The Lure Of The Ringmaster!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60268/', 'id': 60268, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Jewels"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-jewels/4055-60268/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57075/', 'id': 57075, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Skates"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-skates/4055-57075/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3259/', 'id': 3259, 'name': 'Al Milgrom', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/al-milgrom/4040-3259/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3493/', 'id': 3493, 'name': 'Frank Giacoia', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-giacoia/4040-3493/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-12277/', 'id': 12277, 'name': 'Jack Abel', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-abel/4040-12277/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33720/', 'id': 33720, 'name': 'Milt Snapinn', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/milt-snapinn/4040-33720/', 'role': 'letterer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-261-the-lure-of-the-ringmaster/4000-18463/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Unbeknownst to the Ringmaster, and West, they are being tailed by the Flash. Overcoming his bout of jealousy, the Flash breaks off his pursuit, and returns to police headquarters. The captain of the precinct house escorts Doctor Soames to the holding cell. There, Doctor Soames begins her interview/analysis of Lisa Snart, the notorious Golden Glider. Snart uses a diamond-shaped ice cube to mesmerize Soames.</p><p>With Soames thus entranced, Snart reveals the details of her latest revenge scheme against the Flash. Snart had outfoxed the Flash in their last encounter. Snart then hypnotized a young writer, Beau Baer, into becoming her pawn, the Ringmaster. Snart staged a very public confrontation with the Ringmaster, allowing Central City's newest champion to apprehend her. The captain of the precinct house, also mesmerized, returns with Snart's Golden Glider costume, and weaponry.</p><p>Leaving Soames entranced, Snart breaks jail. Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, responds to the alarm, as the Flash. In a matter of seconds, the Flash has searched every floor of police headquarters, until he comes face-to-face with the Golden Glider. The Flash charges the Golden Glider, only to lose traction on the pearls she has strewn across the floor. The Flash skids right out the window. So fast is the Flash, he is able to literally run across the falling shards of glass, back up to the window.</p><p>He stops short, however, when he sees West in an amorous embrace with the Ringmaster, passionately kissing him. The Flash begins to fall. Realizing he's just fallen for one of the Golden Glider's illusions, the Flash skids to a halt along the wall, then runs back up to the window. The Flash leaps onto the Golden Glider's ice-trail, in hot pursuit of his quarry. The ice-trail, however, is being generated by a pair of remote controlled skates. The Golden Glider has made good her escape, and outfoxed the Flash again.</p><p>Realizing he's lost the faith of the populace of Central City, the Flash begins a vigorous campaign of super-speed rescues, and crime fighting. The Ringmaster holds a press conference, with West by his side, offering to team-up with the Flash, to bring the Golden Glider to justice. West returns home to a very jealous husband. The Flash, as Allen, all but accuses West of infidelity. West doesn't deny his accusations. Adding fuel to Allen's anger, and fears, is the fact that West has stopped wearing her wedding ring.</p><p>In it's place on her finger is a ring given to her by the Ringmaster. Abruptly, West storms out, declaring her intention to resume her unmarried life. Allen is left in a state of shock and despair. The Ringmaster escorts West around Central City. Suddenly, their attention is drawn to the falling body of the Flash. The Ringmaster snags the Flash's ankles, and wrist, with his levitating rings. The ""Flash"", though, turns out to simply be a dummy, with a note taped to it, declaring that ""Flash Is Finished!"" The real Flash arrives to accept the Ringmaster's offer of a partnership.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Aquaman in ""<strong>The </strong><strong>Imperiled</strong> <strong>Sub</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,18542,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16639-1995-18542-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",262,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",With This Ring...I Thee Master!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60268/', 'id': 60268, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Jewels"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-jewels/4055-60268/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57075/', 'id': 57075, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Skates"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-skates/4055-57075/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33720/', 'id': 33720, 'name': 'Milt Snapinn', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/milt-snapinn/4040-33720/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-262-with-this-ringi-thee-master/4000-18542/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Allen watches the Picture News broadcast which sums up his current situation. After Allen's failure to capture the Golden Glider, as the Flash, a new hero appeared, the Ringmaster, who succeeded where the Flash had failed. The Golden Glider was quick to escape from police custody, an escape that the Flash failed to stop. The denizens of Central City have embraced the Ringmaster as their new champion, eschewing their current protector, the Flash. To make matters worse, Allen's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, has left Allen, and begun an affair with the Ringmaster.</p><p>At the end of the broadcast, the reporter covering the story suggests that, perhaps, it's time for the Flash to retire. Allen works out his frustrations by running, at super-human speed, on his cosmic treadmill. Suddenly, the Picture News broadcast is interrupted by the Golden Glider, who taunts Allen with the misery she has brought to his life. Allen is, once again, plagued by nightmares. The next morning, West calls on the Ringmaster, in his civilian identity of writer, Beau Baer. Unbeknownst to the two lovers, they are being observed, invisibly, by the Golden Glider. A motorcyclist and a skateboarder are saved from collision, by the Flash and the Ringmaster, who have formed a partnership, to bring the Golden Glider to justice.</p><p>At lunch, in mid-conversation, the Flash, and the Ringmaster, are attacked by the Golden Glider. The Golden Glider hits the two heroes with a deadly snowfall. The contact of each fallen snowflake instills intense pain in the heroes' nervous systems. The Ringmaster is thrown clear of the snow field by the propulsion of his ""retro-rings"". The Flash vibrates his molecules, at super-human speed, becoming insubstantial enough to pass below the street. The Golden Glider presses the attack on the Ringmaster. The Flash resurfaces behind her, and divests the Golden Glider of her skates. Anticipating this tactic, the Golden Glider has rigged her skates to drive the Flash into the ground.</p><p>Once again, the Flash vibrates his molecules to pass harmlessly through the street, a tactic the Golden Glider has also anticipated. The skates also vibrate, interlocking the molecules of the Flash's hands with the skates. The only way to stop his downward plunge through the Earth is to stop vibrating, which would kill the Flash instantly as he materialized within solid rock. The Ringmaster snares the Golden Glider with his paralyzing ring. Slowly, inexorably, the Flash manages to moves his arms, so that the skate will propel him back to the surface. The Flash reaches out to shake the Ringmaster's hand, congratulating him on his victory over the Golden Glider.</p><p>Due to the skates influence over the Flash, his molecules have not entirely ceased their vibrations. The Ringmaster begins shaking uncontrollably. The intense vibrations pass through the Ringmaster, down the chain to his paralytic ring, freeing the Golden Glider. Before the Flash can reach her, the Golden Glider teleports away in a cloud of smoke. Outraged onlookers demand the Flash retire, holding his bungling accountable for the Golden Glider's escape. That night, the Flash, as Allen, takes their request to heart. Packaging up his Flash costume, Allen sends his uniform to police headquarters, with a taped message declaring his retirement.</p><p>Hearing a woman's voice calling out to him, Allen races out at, super-speed, to greet his estranged wife, West. Allen is crestfallen to discover that it is merely his young houseguest, Stacy Conwell. To keep Conwell from learning his secret identity, Allen speeds up until he is moving faster than the eye can see. Conwell never knows that Allen was ever there. While watching West and the Ringmaster in another amorous embrace, the Golden Glider realizes that she has fallen in love with the Ringmaster. The Golden Glider makes plans to remove her rival for the Ringmaster's affections, by manipulating Allen into murdering West.</p><p><strong>Notes: </strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Superman in ""<strong>The Big Fall</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,18626,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/16716-1995-18626-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",263,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""Nobody Stays A Flash Forever!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60268/', 'id': 60268, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Jewels"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-jewels/4055-60268/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57075/', 'id': 57075, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Skates"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-skates/4055-57075/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3493/', 'id': 3493, 'name': 'Frank Giacoia', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-giacoia/4040-3493/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2056/', 'id': 2056, 'name': 'Joe Staton', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-staton/4040-2056/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-263-nobody-stays-a-flash-forever/4000-18626/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

On the tape is a recorded message from the Flash, declaring his retirement from crime fighting. The commissioner asks police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, to authenticate the recording. Allen removes any doubt as to the authenticity of the recording. Meanwhile, the Golden Glider comes to grips with her newborn adoration of the Ringmaster, the new champion of Central City. Unbeknownst to the Ringmaster, he is also a pawn in the Golden Glider's latest revenge scheme against the Flash. More to the point, the Ringmaster was actually created by the Golden Glider.</p><p>The Golden Glider realizes that the man she selected to be the Ringmaster, Beau Baer, bears haunting similarities to the long dead love of her life, Roscoe Dillon, the notorious Top. Even the Ringmaster's costume design is reminiscent of the Top's. As part of her scheme to sow misery into the Flash's life, the Golden Glider had mesmerized the Flash's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, into falling in love with the Ringmaster. Now West had become a rival for the Golden Glider's own affections for Baer. To rid herself of West, the Golden Glider hits upon a scheme to manipulate Allen into murdering West.</p><p>Allen awakens to find an atomizer of perfume on his night table, with a note to his wife attached. Though he has no recollection of making the purchase, Allen chalks it up to the absent-mindedness he has been experiencing, since West walked out on him. Allen delivers the atomizer to West, at the Picture News offices. West is at a loss for words, upon receipt of the gift, but nonetheless holds true to her new love for Baer. Suddenly the atomizer explodes, incinerating West. Allen falls down to his knees in despair over his wife's death. West's co-workers contact the authorities, who arrest Allen for the murder of his wife.</p><p>In truth, Allen, moving faster than the eye could see, spirited West away to a safe haven, while leaving evidence of her ""death"" behind, then returned before anyone could notice that he had moved. The Ringmaster takes down two would-be bank robbers. After departing the scene, the Golden Glider appears in the Ringmaster's arms, dropping her screen of invisibility. As the Golden Glider had mesmerized the Ringmaster into loving West, his affections have now been hypnotically redirected to the Golden Glider. Allen fakes his death, in the manner he faked West's, and escapes from his jail cell. Before  leaving police headquarters, Allen, running faster than the eye can see, collects his Flash uniform, and resumes his costumed identity.</p><p>Upon hearing the news of Allen's ""death"", the Golden Glider readies herself for her inevitable showdown with the Flash. West finds herself tied up, in the Flash Museum, watched over by the museum's curator, Dexter Myles. The ring which held hypnotic sway over West has slipped off her finger, restoring her feelings for Allen. To draw the Flash out, the Golden Glider envelops the Flash Museum in a giant emerald of pure force. One the Flash cannot penetrate. With the Flash distracted by the Golden Glider, the Ringmaster is able to snag the Flash with one of his special rings. As soon as the Flash attempts to vibrate his way free, the ring locks onto his molecular structure, stretching, and flattening the Flash out, until he fills the ring.</p><p>Using his booster rings to enhance his strength, the Ringmaster hurls the Flash out of the city. The Flash exercises his complete control over his body's molecular structure to bend the ring into a boomerang, which swings back into the Golden Glider, and the Ringmaster. The Flash dodges the Ringmaster's attack, then spins his former rival around, at great velocity, until centrifugal force has completely disarmed the Ringmaster. The Flash turns to confront the Golden Glider, only to find her frozen, encased in a block of ice. West has used Captain Cold's Cold Gun, taken from the Flash Museum, to end the threat of the Golden Glider.</p><p>The Flash announces the end of his retirement. Baer, finally back in command of his mental faculties, announces his retirement as the Ringmaster. Allen and West enjoy a long overdue, and very happy, reunion.</p>",,,,,,,False,18700,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3466901-%24t2ec16nhjgiffo9mjc4mbsk5eliqcq~~60_3.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",264,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-50067/', 'id': 50067, 'name': 'Flash Museum', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-museum/4020-50067/'}]","""The Golden Glider's Final Fling!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57075/', 'id': 57075, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Skates"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-skates/4055-57075/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3493/', 'id': 3493, 'name': 'Frank Giacoia', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-giacoia/4040-3493/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2056/', 'id': 2056, 'name': 'Joe Staton', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-staton/4040-2056/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31728/', 'id': 31728, 'name': 'Kurt Schaffenberger', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kurt-schaffenberger/4040-31728/', 'role': 'penciler'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-264-the-golden-glider-s-final-fling/4000-18700/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Though Allen has agreed to leave his Flash identity behind, while they're away, a sudden blowout forces him into super-speed action. Allen manages to exit the car, remove the blown tire, replace it with the spare tire, and return to the car, all without West ever noticing that he moved at all. Allen veers off the main highway onto a dirt road. West is puzzled until Allen arrives at the Hideaway Hotel. Though the Allens made no reservations, the front clerk seems to have been expecting them. The Allens are told to wear their pendents at all times, the same as the other guests.</p><p>In their hotel room, Allen confesses that he knew nothing at all about the hotel, but suddenly felt compelled to drive there. Realizing they've inadvertently taken the place of another couple, Allen, as the Flash, heads out to look for them. The Flash finds the other couple's car, at the bottom of a rockslide. Digging them out, the Flash confirms that the other couple has, in fact, died. The Flash removes their pendents, then sequesters their bodies in a nearby cave. Back at the hotel, the Flash, as Allen, realizes that he must have picked up the same homing signal the pendents receive, when he was moving at super-human speed to change the tire.</p><p>Their pendents suddenly begin glowing brighter than normal, prompting the Allens to join the other guests in an underground chamber, beneath the hotel. There, they are addressed by a strangely garbed man, who outlines a horrific plan to shift the Earth in dimensional space, with another planet, so that the Earth is enveloped in a comet's tail. Allen realizes that the other guests at the hotel are all aliens. These aliens have occupied the Earth for over a year, monitoring Cosmictron Power Rods, which will shift the Earth in dimensional space with their own planet, when the comet passes through their space again.</p><p>The briefing is interrupted when the couple the Allens replaced enter the room, clearly still alive. The aliens de-activate the illuso-aura, provided by the pendents, revealing themselves as aliens, and exposing the Allens as terrestrials. Allen races West out of the chamber, donning his Flash costume as he goes. Four blaster pistols pursue them. The Flash draws the guns off, engaging in evasive maneuvers. Ultimately, the Flash aligns the guns into a crossfire, that he evades, causing the guns to fire on one another. The Flash's super-speed vibrations upset the delicate balance of the aliens' Power Flux Wheel generators, leaving them without enough power to activate the dimensional shift.</p><p>The Flash learns the aliens purpose is actually beneficial to the Earth. When their planet was exposed to the comet's tail, it completely immunized their populace against all lethal microbes. The aliens merely wished to share their good fortune with another world. The Flash races along, inside the Power Flux Wheel, generating more than enough power to shift Earth into the alien dimension. The Earth is caught in the comet's trail, then shifts back to it's rightful location. The aliens return to their world, while the Allens resume their second honeymoon.</p><h3><ins>Secret Of The Shooting Star!</ins></h3><p>Camp counseler, Wally West, is out in the woods, with a group of young boys, to watch the meteor shower. One of the shooting stars fails to burn up in the atmosphere, revealing itself to be an alien craft, that lands in the camp. West, and the children are hit with a blinding flash, as the alien exits it's craft. The light momentarily paralyzes the boys, allowing West to go into action, as Kid Flash. Kid Flash charges the alien, only to be hurled back into the lake, by a protective force field. Kid Flash switches tactics, running around the alien, surrounding it in a field of densely, compressed air.</p><p>The alien is, again, unfazed. One of the children suddenly mutates into a horrific brute. Kid Flash is violently seized by the monstrous youth and thrown into the alien's view screen. Kid Flash manages to generate an air cushion, at super-speed, to soften his impact with the screen. A chipmunk also mutates into a gigantic horror, and chases after two of the children. Kid Flash attacks the woodland monstrosity, then cages it in a pen made of trees. Two more boys transform into gruesome monsters. Moving at super-speed, Kid Flash sees the radiation wave responsible for the terrifying transformations.</p><p>To avoid the wave, Kid Flash dives into the lake. The radiation purifies the previously polluted lake. Kid Flash sees an image of himself, as West, and the children, appear on the screen. Kid Flash realizes that the alien is merely a harmless tourist, who came to Earth to take pictures. The radiation given off during the developing process temporarily mutated the children, and the woodchuck. As the alien departs, Kid Flash invites the children to go swimming in the newly cleansed lake.</p>",,,,,,,False,18785,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3466904-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21l0fjr%2Ct3biobscsr%29z-8g~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",265,[],"""Shift The Earth Goodbye""/Secret Of The Shooting Star!","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7955/', 'id': 7955, 'name': 'Alex Saviuk', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/alex-saviuk/4040-7955/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-11342/', 'id': 11342, 'name': 'Bob Smith', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bob-smith/4040-11342/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3493/', 'id': 3493, 'name': 'Frank Giacoia', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-giacoia/4040-3493/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-52600/', 'id': 52600, 'name': 'Mario Sen', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mario-sen/4040-52600/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-33720/', 'id': 33720, 'name': 'Milt Snapinn', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/milt-snapinn/4040-33720/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-44124/', 'id': 44124, 'name': 'Paul Kupperberg', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/paul-kupperberg/4040-44124/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-265-shift-the-earth-goodbye-secret-of-th/4000-18785/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The museum is currently exhibiting the treasures of King Ah-Mose. On hand for the exhibit's opening are Picture News reporter, Iris West, and her husband, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. Heat Wave makes his dramatic entrance, burning his way out of the pyramid. Heat Wave's infra-red rays cause the museum guards' bullets to explode in their guns, and on their person. Heat Wave ramps up the intensity of his infra-red rays until the guards pass out from the extreme heat. Allen makes his own dramatic entrance, as the Flash.</p><p>After quickly taking out Heat Wave's gang, the Flash goes after Heat Wave. The Flash finds a hole burned into the floor. Suspecting a trap, the Flash chooses to vibrate his way through the floor, rather than leap down the hole. Heat Wave, though, has anticipated this tactic, and turned the metal floor molten. The Flash's boots immediately melt to the floor, leaving him a sitting duck. Heat Wave fires on the Flash, but the Flash dodges by leaping up out of his boots. The blast from Heat Wave's Hot Rod strikes the air conditioning unit, causing it to explode. The Flash vibrates his molecules into intangibility, allowing the shrapnel to pass harmlessly through him. Heat Wave leaps for cover.</p><p>Despite his precautions, the Flash is still struck by a piece of flying debris, that renders him unconscious. Rather than finish the Flash off, while he's helpless, Heat Wave, curiously, flees the scene. Puzzled over his own compulsive behavior, Heat Wave, as Mick Rory, makes an appointment to see Doctor Synett, the underworld's psychiatrist. Placing Rory under hypnosis, Synett zeroes in on Rory's issues. As a boy, Rory had taken a school field trip to a meat packing plant. Rory broke off from his class to do some exploring on his own, ending up accidentally locked in one of the freezers. Desperately, Rory blew hot air on his hands to warm them up enough to work the latch.</p><p>Rory escaped the freezer, but from that moment on he could never be warm enough. His obsession with heat and warmth eventually led him to taking a job as a carnival fire-eater. From there, it was a short journey to his costumed criminal identity, Heat Wave. Synett's diagnosis is cryophobia. To prove his point, he hurls a bucket of ice at Rory, causing Rory to fall to the floor, on his knees, in terror. Synett declares that Rory's cryophobia is the reason he fled the scene, when the air conditioning unit exploded, coating everything in frost. It's also why he always loses in battles with his rival, <a href=""/captain-cold/4005-2392/"" data-ref-id=""4005-2392"">Captain Cold. </a></p><p>Primarily, though, it's why Rory has never achieved his full criminal potential, as Heat Wave. Synett, though, promises to change all that. The Flash receives word that the head butler, of the Alden Norton estate, has been trying to reach him. An arctic explorer, Norton had his estate fashioned to look like a giant igloo. Dying of a terminal disease, Norton had himself frozen, to be revived in the year 2100. The Flash meets up with Alden's head butler, only to find the staff behaving as if mesmerized. It's a trap, one laid by Heat Wave. After avoiding Heat Wave's heat seeking beam, the Flash mercilessly beats Heat Wave into unconsciousness.</p><p>Unmasking Heat Wave, the Flash sees the face of Norton's head butler. The Flash realizes, too late, that Heat Wave is disguised as the head butler. The Flash is struck down from behind. Heat Wave unmasks the Flash, but doesn't recognize his true identity. Having removed Norton's frozen body, Heat Wave puts the Flash in his place. The Flash is left in cryogenic suspended animation. With the Flash out of commission for the next century, Heat Wave makes plans to embark on a crime spree, the likes of which Central City has never seen.</p><h3><ins>""The Case of the Missing Super-Speed!""</ins></h3><p>Kid Flash races to keep Howie Cramer from being struck by lightning. The save is especially close, with both youths receiving a bit of a shock. The next day, Kid Flash, as Wally West, and his parents, are at the bank to deposit West's summer earnings. As West and his parents exit the bank, they are followed by a super-humanly fast bank robber. West gives chase, as Kid Flash. The robber easily eludes Kid Flash, though, as Kid Flash has lost his super-speed powers. Kid Flash, as West, contemplates his situation. West had planned to retire his costumed identity after college, but now considers ending his career immediately.</p><p>Liza Bodner first distracts West, then provides him with the insight needed to get his super-speed back. West realizes that his powers were transferred to Cramer, when they both took that glancing lightning strike. West also determines that Cramer must be the super-speed thief. West, as Kid Flash, tracks down and confronts Cramer. Though Cramer possesses Kid Flash's super-speed, Kid Flash's greater combat experience allows him to gain the upper hand. Luring Cramer in close, Kid Flash uses a downed power line to effect the transfer of his super-speed out of Cramer, and back into his own body.

Heat Wave places the Flash into a cryogenic deep freeze, where the Flash will remain, undisturbed, for the next century. Heat Wave video tapes his victory, for posterity, leaving the tape to be discovered when the Flash is, finally, thawed out. Regaining consciousness, the Flash has only seconds to act before he succumbs to the numbing cold of suspended animation. Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flash sloughs off stray molecules into the cryogenic chamber. The impact of the Flash's high velocity molecules, with the chamber's molecules, begins a chain reaction resulting in a powerful vibratory wave.</p><p>The tremors spread out across the floor, up the walls, to the ceiling. A ceiling fragment shatters the cryogenic chamber, freeing the Flash. The vibratory wave continues to spread throughout the house, eventually causing the entire structure to collapse. The Flash barely has time to get the servants out of the house, before it crumbles into debris. Young Barney Sands, the next door neighbor of Picture News reporter, Iris West, and her husband, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, pays a call on Allen. West rebuffs Sands' visit, stating that Allen is busy working on his collection. Curious, Sands peeps through the den window, and sees Allen filing away a large Golden Age comic book collection. Sands realizes that he and Allen are kindred spirits.</p><p>The cryogenic chamber's effect, coupled with the rapid thaw, has affected the Flash's molecular structure, causing his body to convert into energy, whenever he uses his super-human speed. As he patrols the streets of Central City, in search of Heat Wave, citizens are startled to see a literal crimson comet pass by them. The Flash catches up with Heat Wave, at a jewelry expo, within the Central City coliseum. The Flash dodges Heat Wave's first volley, by splitting his mass in twain. Upon reforming, Heat Wave catches the Flash with the highest setting of his Hot Rod. The Flash loses control of his molecular structure, launching into the air, a runaway comet heading into space.</p><p>The Flash manages to shift his energy form into one of pure light. Altering his trajectory, the Flash strikes the mirrored surface of a solar panel, and is reflected back towards the Earth. Heat Wave's blast of intense heat counters the effects of the cryogenic chamber on the Flash's molecular structure, returning him to normal. The Flash mercilessly beats Heat Wave into unconsciousness. In his cell, Heat Wave, as Mick Rory, takes solace in the notion that he has seen the Flash's unmasked face. The Flash, as Allen, faces an uncertain future, as he worries over what Rory plans to do with that knowledge.</p><h3><ins>""Origin Of The Flash's Uniform!""</ins></h3><p>Police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is simultaneously struck by lightning, while being doused with chemicals. The combination results in Allen developing the power to move at super-human speed. Taking inspiration from his favorite comic book character, Allen decides to embark on a crime fighting career, as the Flash. Allen, though, finds the Golden Age Flash's costume impractical. While Allen is pondering the matter, he receives a phone call from his girl friend, Picture News reporter, Iris West. Distracted by all that has happened to him, Allen has stood West up, for a date, and she is furious. West breaks up with Allen over the phone.</p><p>Allen, though, is more concerned with how he's going to get his costume made. Allen approaches West's father, Ira, a brilliant scientist. Allen revels his newfound powers to Professor West, by playing a game of table tennis, with himself. Allen hands Professor West the design he's drawn for the costume. Unbeknownst to the two men, a pair of thugs are outside, waiting for the opportunity to steal Professor West's valuable stamp collection. Professor West use his skills as a tailor to sew Allen's Flash costume. Professor West also uses his inventive brilliance to create a special gas that expands or contracts the uniform, so that it may be stored in, or released from, a ring.</p><p>Allen receives a call from Professor West, who fears that prowlers may have broken into his home. Professor West is violently struck from behind, and the phone line goes dead. Allen immediately races over, as the Flash. After beating the two thugs into unconsciousness, the Flash races Professor West to the hospital. Upon recovery, Professor West has no recollection that Allen is the Flash. The blow to the head has also resulted in an acute absent-mindedness, which will plague the professor to the end of his days. Allen decides that it's for the best that Professor West is no longer privy to his secret identity.</p><p><strong>Notes: </strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad,

The bear gets the drop on the Flash, delivering a powerful blow to the back of his head, before grappling with him. The Flash escapes with a super-speed created updraft. The Flash excavates out a large pit, to hold the bear until the proper authorities can take possession of it. Returning home, the Flash, as police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, has just enough time to get out of costume, before Sands enters his house. Sands returns Allen's portable microscope, then assists Allen with sorting through Allen's large, Golden Age comic book collection.</p><p>Sands finds his  missing comic, in Allen's collection. Allen is puzzled at the discovery, as he has never had that particular issue. Allen asks Sands to leave the comic book with him, for further investigation. Allen returns to his den, where, right before his eyes, the comic book vanishes. Allen, as the Flash, attunes his vibratory rate to the energy signature which teleported the comic book, and follows it to a comic book convention. The comic appears among the collection of one of the dealers.

At super-speed, Allen escapes the gunsels, by ducking into a closing elevator. Allen dons his Flash costume, and tears off after the crooks. Catching up with the two thugs' cab, the Flash drags them out onto the street. When they refuse to give up any information, the Flash beats them into unconsciousness. The cab driver is overjoyed at his good luck, in finding the valuable comic book on the backseat of his cab. Before the cab driver can read the comic, a gun is placed at his temple, and he is ordered to hand the magazine over. A group of organized crime figures meet to discuss the comic book.</p><p>A deceased scientist, Professor Philip Denton, made huge advances in the field of telepathic teleportation, with the invention of Formula XCV-4. Denton doused the comic with the formula, then traveled greater and greater distances with it. Each time, Denton would ask his son to concentrate on the comic, which would cause the comic to appear before his son. Using the comic, the crooks intend to learn Denton's formula, so that they can remove the risk from theft. Before they can bid on who will take possession of the formula drenched comic book, it disappears, reappearing in the Flash's hand.</p><p>The crooks open fire on the Flash, only to find themselves being pinned to the walls by centrifugal force. The Flash ramps up the intensity until the very walls of the house collapse. The criminals, along with the comic book, are turned over to the proper authorites. The Flash, as Allen, presents Sands with a copy of the comic book. In their attempts to find the comic, the crooks had tracked down and purchased multiple copies of it. Sands and Allen both end up with mint condition copies of the comic book, to add to their respective collections.</p>",,,,,,,False,19009,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/17062-1995-19009-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",268,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Riddle of the Runaway Comic,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48153/', 'id': 48153, 'name': 'Mike Stevens', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-stevens/4040-48153/', 'role': 'letterer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-268-riddle-of-the-runaway-comic/4000-19009/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Gail had been suffering headaches, brought on by premonitions. After predicting the collapse of a local discotheque, Gail collapsed. Kid Flash rushed Gail to the hospital. Kid Flash, as Wally West, waits for news on Gail's condition, at the hospital. Doctor Manners inquires as to Kid Flash's whereabouts. Doctor Manners has a theory regarding his daughter's coma, but needs Kid Flash's help to test said theory.</p><p>Though too late to prevent a car collision with a fuel truck, the Flash rescues both drivers before they can come to any harm. The Flash generates a powerful updraft to carry the flames away from the wreckage, then creates a vacuum to extinguish them. The Flash is just about to stamp out the pools of flaming oil, on the street, when Kid Flash beats him to it. The two converse at super-human speed, as Kid Flash brings the Flash up to date on the Manners situation.</p><p>Years ago, the Manners, along with the Flash, Kid Flash, and Picture News reporter, Iris West, had been on an expedition to South America. Inexplicably, the violent tremors of an earthquake hurled the expedition party back in time. Gail Manners psychic abilities began to manifest, shorty after returning to the present. Doctor Manners believes that by returning to the exact location of his previous expedition, as well as traveling back into the past, a solution to his daughter's coma can be found.</p><p>The Flash agrees to accompany Kid Flash. Upon reaching the South American coastline, the Flash uses his cosmic treadmill to transport their entire ship, and all it's crew, back into the prehistoric past. Almost immediately, the ship is attacked by an Alzadasaurus. While Kid Flash pummels the creature's head, the Flash kicks up a powerful undertow that pushes the creature back out to sea. Kid Flash is thrown into the seabed, when the dinosaur dives beneath the waves.</p><p>Noticing that Kid Flash is nowhere to be seen, the Flash dives back below the surface, and digs Kid Flash out of the mire. Back on board the ship, the group is relieved to see Gail come out of her coma. The Flash and Kid Flash do some scouting. During their travels through the primeval landscape, they bear witness to several species of dinosaurs, employing advanced problem solving techniques, to better their lives. When the two heroes pause to discuss the situation, they're ambushed by Gryk-5, a reptilian alien.</p><p>Gryk-5 attempts to vaporize the Scarlet Speedsters, but they merely vibrate their molecules into intangibility, and slip beneath the ground. Coming up behind Gryk-5, the Flash and Kid Flash spin him around at high velocity. Gryk-5 teleports out of the speedsters' grip. Searching in ever widening circles, the Scarlet Speedsters track Gryk-5 back to the aliens' base camp, hidden within a dormant volcano. Using their Remma device, the aliens are boosting the dinosaurs' natural evolutionary growth, so that they remain the dominant species of the Earth.</p><p>While the Flash distracts the aliens into attacking him, Kid Flash runs around the volcano, generating enough vibratory force to cause an eruption. The explosive release of magma destroys the Remma device. The aliens depart the Earth in failure. Gail speculates that the radiation, given off by the Remma device, endowed her with psychic abilities, while also being responsible for her coma. With the mystery solved, the Flash uses his cosmic treadmill to return everyone to the present.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Superman in ""<strong>An Unbeatable Power</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,19162,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3468922-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",269,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56960/', 'id': 56960, 'name': 'South America', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/south-america/4020-56960/'}]","""Domain Of The Dark-Eyed Dragons!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31825/', 'id': 31825, 'name': 'Irv Novick', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/irv-novick/4040-31825/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-269-domain-of-the-dark-eyed-dragons/4000-19162/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-56551/', 'id': 56551, 'name': 'Dinosaurs', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dinosaurs/4060-56551/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-55633/', 'id': 55633, 'name': 'Speedsters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/speedsters/4060-55633/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Alerted to the Flash's presence by one of the incapacitated police officers, the clown goes on the offensive. The clown launches his pogo stick at the Flash, then flees in an old jalopy. The Flash easily fends off the clown's attack, quickly catching up to him. The shell of the jalopy falls away, revealing a souped up hot rod. Locking onto the Flash's heat signature, the discarded pieces of the jalopy come barreling towards him. Vibrating his molecules into intangibility, the Flash dives beneath the street, to avoid the collision.</p><p>Without missing a beat, the Flash resumes his pursuit. Just as the Flash is about to lay hands on the clown, he is pied in the face. The pie is saturated with ether, knocking the Flash out. A mysterious figure makes plans to steal 15 ounces of heroin from the evidence room, at police headquarters. The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is called into a meeting with the Chief of Detectives, Captain Harvey Paulson. Allen learns that his graduate thesis paper has become the guiding inspiration for the Nephron Process. Allen is ordered to attend a meeting with Professor Gilbert Nephron, at the state penitentiary.</p><p>Allen calls home to break his dinner plans, incurring the wrath of his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West. A mysterious woman looks over her shrine to the Flash, bemoaning the fact that she doesn't know what the Flash looks like underneath his mask. Allen arrives at the penitentiary, and attends a demonstration on aversion therapy. Nephron believes that criminals can be programmed to feel an abject aversion towards criminal acts, thus ending their threat to society. Allen has his doubts. Nephron's demonstration is broadcast to every cell in the prison. At the end of his lecture, Nephron asks for volunteers, from the prison populace, to undergo his process.</p><p>Any man that does will be granted a full pardon, by the governor, regardless of his crimes. Only one man volunteers, murderer Clive Yorkin. At police headquarters, a pair of shadowy figures move the heroin, from the evidence lock-up to Allen's laboratory, disguising it among the bottles of chemicals. The next morning, Allen finds his wife is still not speaking to him. En route to work, Allen, as the Flash, sees a large, gaseous ""HA HA"" floating over the city. Further investigation leads to a steam powered calliope, rolling down the street. The Flash spies a tuft of the clown's hair beneath a manhole cover. Creating a powerful updraft, at super-human speed, the Flash pulls the clown from the sewers.</p><p>As the clown is lifted into the air, the Flash notes that he's attached to a coiled metal spring. As he rises higher into the air, a cluster of dynamite, tangled in the coil, reaches street level, and detonates. The Flash is able to avoid the primary explosion, but finds himself caught in the blast wave. Vibrating his molecules at super-human speed, the Flash is able to partially slip through a brick wall, instead of slamming into it.

When the smoke clears, the Flash has, seemingly, been obliterated. The Central City Police Department are quick to move in on the Flash's murderer, the Clown. Launched from an ejector seat, the Clown uses his incredible acrobatic prowess to tumble to a rooftop. Instead of fleeing, the Clown doubles back, descending on the officers, riding a rocket-powered flying trapeze. The Clown's shoes begin spraying the officers with a cloying form of cotton candy, which begins to harden and suffocate them.</p><p>The Flash, barely on his feet, crawls from the debris, shattered pieces of the wall, protruding from every square inch of his body. Despite the immense pain of moving, the Flash rescues the officers, before racing home. With his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, waiting on him, the Flash carefully vibrates, at super-human speed, into intangibility, until he has separated the wall debris from his molecular structure. Frustrated with waiting, West storms out. A mysterious woman removes a piece of the wall debris from the crime scene. By some strange sway she has over the police, not a single officer bars her presence.</p><p>The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is required to attend the first human trial of the Nephron Project. Through aversion therapy, the Nephron Process purports to be able to remove criminal urges from criminals. Convicted murderer, Clive Yorkin, volunteers for the Nephron Process, in exchange for a full pardon, for his crimes, from the governor. Yorkin is strapped into a chair, and forced to watch several criminal acts. As each image appears on the screen before him, Yorkin experiences agonizing pain. Yorkin weathers the ordeal, only to pass out at the first image of non-criminal activity. Allen is dubious regarding the methodology, as well as the ethics, of the Nephron Process.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Clown sends a package, to the Flash, by way of police headquarters. As the Clown exits his hotel room, the wind catches the pages of scrapbook. The articles pasted into the scrapbook concern a circus accident, that occurred during a blackout. Three aerialists fell to their deaths, with a fourth severely injured. At the site of a future power plant, the Clown abducts the Governor, the Mayor, and the President of the power company. The package delivered to police headquarters has an article about the Flash's charity appearance at the circus. An appearance the Flash never made, on account of a <a href=""/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/"" data-ref-id=""4060-31815"">Justice League of America</a> emergency.</p><p>Word reaches the police station regarding the abductions. Allen, as the Flash, scours the city, in search of the Clown, and his victims. The Governor, Mayor, and power company president awaken in chairs, attached to a single wheel, slowly riding across a high tension line. A fourth chair remains empty. The Flash arrives to apprehend the Clown, only to be paralyzed by a single sonic note, played on the Clown's calliope. With the Flash frozen before him, the Clown clubs the Flash into unconsciousness. The Flash awakens in the fourth chair, still largely immobilized. The Clown causes the power lines to sputter and smoke. In a matter of moments, the lines will give, plunging the Clown's victims to their deaths, in a re-enactment of the circus tragedy.... and the Flash can do nothing to prevent it.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad ""<strong>Wonder Woman vs The Cheetah</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,19337,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3468938-%24%28kgrhqj%2C%21hwfbdfwcisdbqclstsvnw~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",271,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Silent Slayer of Central City!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-12277/', 'id': 12277, 'name': 'Jack Abel', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jack-abel/4040-12277/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-271-the-silent-slayer-of-central-city/4000-19337/,1978-12-12,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Below them, the diabolical Clown plays chords, on a calliope, to keep the Flash paralyzed, while simultaneously shorting out the gyros in the rig. For several seconds, the Flash is able to maintain their balance, with a steadying pole. Then, they begin to pitch over.</p><p>With a herculean effort, the Flash snaps his restraints, then hurls the pole at the clown, knocking him from the calliope. With the sonic chord silenced, the Flash regains his power of super-human speed. The Flash races across the wires, down the tower to the ground, where he catches his fellow victims. The Clown regains the calliope, forcing the Flash to run faster than the speed of sound to avoid being paralyzed again. The Flash generates a sonic boom, that unseats the Clown from the calliope, then dismantles the calliope at super-speed.</p><p>The Flash uses the shattered pipes of the calliope to cage the Clown. Before losing consciousness, the Clown writes ""Help Me"" in the sand. The police quickly arrive to take control of the situation. Unbeknownst to the Flash, he is being observed, from afar, by a mysterious young woman. The following day, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, continues his observation of the Nephron Project. The highly experimental Nephron Process uses aversion therapy to rehabilitate criminals.</p><p>Murderer, Clive Yorkin, has volunteered to submit to the Nephron Process, in exchange for a full pardon, from the governor, for his crimes. Having second thought, Yorkin attempts to flee, only to be brought down by a pair of brutish orderlies. As Yorkin is strapped into the chair, for his next treatment, Allen voices his objections. Allen threatens to expose the Nephron Project to the media, over his growing ethical and moral concerns. The head of the Nephron Project agrees to suspend their research.</p><p>As soon as Allen leaves, however, Yorkin's treatments resume. Back in his laboratory, at police headquarters, Allen is drawn to an inexplicable chemical reaction, by his assistant, Patty Spivot. Allen checks the contents of the bottle of silver nitrate, and discovers that it is heroin. The exact same amount of heroin that recently went missing from the evidence room. After confirming his findings, Allen returns the bottle to the shelf. Allen rigs an alarm to the shelf that will notify him when the bottle is moved.</p><p>Allen arrives home for a midnight dinner with his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West. Before the first course can be served, Allen's alarm is triggered. Allan heads back out, as the Flash, leaving behind his increasingly frustrated wife. Rather than apprehend the person stealing heroin from police headquarters, the Flash opts to follow him, in the hopes of bringing down all parties involved. Invisibly in pursuit of the thief, the Flash suddenly feels an uncontrollable compulsion to run in a different direction.</p><p>Try as he might, the Flash cannot resist the compulsion. The Flash finds himself racing towards a brick wall. Speeding up, the Flash vibrates his molecular structure into intangibility, to pass harmlessly through the wall. The wall, however, turns out to have been an illusion. When a second wall appears before him, the Flash makes the mistake of believing it also to be illusory. The Flash crashes... hard... into the wall, rendering himself unconscious. The same mysterious woman, who had surreptitiously spied on him from afar, steps forward. Her plans for the Flash... unknown.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Superman in ""<strong>The Ionic Storm</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,19404,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3468942-%24t2ec16dhjiyfhoh0eunybso5zu%2Cdh%21~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",272,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Girl with the Master Mind...,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-35347/', 'id': 35347, 'name': 'John Calnan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-calnan/4040-35347/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42253/', 'id': 42253, 'name': 'José Luis García-López', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jose-luis-garcia-lopez/4040-42253/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14053/', 'id': 14053, 'name': 'Rich Buckler', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rich-buckler/4040-14053/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4256/', 'id': 4256, 'name': 'Vince Colletta', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vince-colletta/4040-4256/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-272-the-girl-with-the-master-mind/4000-19404/,1979-01-09,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Obsessed with the Flash, Melanie has forged a psychic bond with him, enabling her to take limited control over the Flash. Still in a daze, the Flash sees Melanie looking, lovingly, down at him. As he regains full consciousness, Melanie's visage is replaced with that of two attack dogs.</p><p>The dogs' jaws clamp down on the Flash's extremities, forcing the Scarlet Speedster to vibrate his way to freedom. A quick perimeter check reveals that the Flash is outside of the Tabor Institute For Psychic Research. Searching the institute, the Flash discovers a virtual shrine to him in a young woman's room. Meanwhile, Melanie meets up with a few friends at a local discotheque. Melanie declines the offers to dance, from other men, viewing them as ""too ordinary"". Only the Flash will satisfy her.</p><p>The Flash arrives home to find his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, still awake in bed. West attempts to engage her husband in conversation, but the exhausted speedster quickly passes out. West makes an appointment at a trendy salon for a complete makeover. The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is asked to ride over to the penitentiary, with Harvey Paulson, the chief of police. Paulson voices concerns over Allen's shoddy job performance.</p><p>Allen voices his concerns over the Nephron Project, deciding that he no longer wishes to be associated with it. Allen also reveals his suspicions, regarding crooked police officers moving heroin from the evidence room, back out onto the streets. Paulson gives Alllen the night off. West is excited to show off her new look, but Allen is distracted by news of a prison riot, occurring at the penitentiary. Allen heads out, as the Flash, infuriating his wife, who breaks down, sobbing, in his absence.</p><p>Rebelling against the inhumane Nephron Project, the rioting prisoners hurl it's architect, Doctor Gilbert Nephron, off the penitentiary roof. The Flash rescues Nephron, then storms the prison. After fighting his way through hordes of prisoners, the Flash backs the guards up, outside the cafeteria. The prisoners bombard the officers, and the Flash, with a slew of pots and pans. The prisoners momentarily gain the advantage over the Flash, and begin taking turns beating him.</p><p>The Flash recovers, vibrating himself out of the grip of a hulking convict. The Flash races to the infirmary, then doses every single inmate, in the prison, with a powerful sedative. The riot quelled, the Flash seeks out murderer, Clive Yorkin. It was on Yorkin's behalf that the other prisoners rioted. Yorkin was the sole volunteer for the Nephron Process, an attempt at rehabilitation through aversion therapy. The treatments, though, have irreparably damaged Yorkin's mind. The Flash finally locates Yorkin, hooked up to the machines, unsupervised, that administer the Nephron Process. The treatments have driven Yorkin insane.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Wonder Woman in ""<strong>The Golden Treasure</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,19478,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3468943-%24%28kgrhquokpyfis52ttotbso5%2Bgj0qg~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",273,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""Harvest of Hate""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7955/', 'id': 7955, 'name': 'Alex Saviuk', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/alex-saviuk/4040-7955/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43258/', 'id': 43258, 'name': 'Frank Chiaramonte', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-chiaramonte/4040-43258/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'editor, penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-273-harvest-of-hate/4000-19478/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Yorkin, clearly insane, keeps depressing the pain button, inflicting agonizing trauma to his brain. When the Flash attempts to remove Yorkin from the machine, Yorkin, in a rage, attacks the Flash. The Flash is taken aback by Yorkin's super-human strength, an apparent side effect of the Nephron Process. The Flash vibrates his molecules, at super-human speed, to wrench himself free of Yorkin's crushing grip.</p><p>Impossibly, Yorkin is able to vibrate in sync with the Flash. Yorkin hurls the Flash through the floor, where he falls five floors, to the basement. Doctor Gilbert Nephron confronts Yorkin. By the time the Flash returns, two prison guards have been rendered unconscious, and Yorkin has fled. Left behind is Nephron, strapped into his own machine, with both the pain and pleasure centers of his brain being overstimulated simultaneously. The overload has left Nephron a vegetable.</p><p>The Flash follows Yorkin's path of destruction to an open manhole grate. Yorkin has escaped through the sewers. The next morning, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, meets with the Chief of Police, Harvey Paulson. Allen is introduced to Detective Frank Curtis, an undercover narcotics officer. Heroin is being moved from the evidence room through Allen's laboratory, and back out onto the street. Allen and Curtis are asked to investigate the matter.</p><p>Curtis has already tracked down the smugglers' base of operations. Fearing a large police presence would tip off the dirty cops in the department, Curtis and Allen opt to do the bust themselves. Unbeknownst to them, their conversation is eavesdropped upon by a shady character, who informs the smugglers of their intent. Allen and Curtis storm the smugglers' warehouse, only to find it empty. It's a trap. Gunmen fire on Allen and Curtis from the shadows.</p><p>Allen is hit, but vibrates his molecular structure, at super-human speed, to intangibility, allowing the bullets to pass harmlessly through him. Curtis tells Allen to run, while he attempts to take out the car pursuing them. Allen pretends to let the car hit him. Underneath the car, Allen switches into his Flash costume.

His wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, was attacked by deranged murderer, Clive Yorkin. Allen, barely conscious, staggers to his feet, to go after Yorkin. Allen jumps/falls out of a window, landing hard in the shrubbery below. By the time Detective Frank Curtis makes it outside, Allen is gone. As the Flash, Allen confronts Yorkin. The Flash mercilessly batters Yorkin's face in, until the flesh begins to melt like hot wax.</p><p>Allen wakes up, strapped down to a hospital bed. His battle with Yorkin nothing more than a drug fueled delusion. Vibrating his molecules into intangibility, Allen escapes his restraints. In a drug-fueled rage, Allen struggles against two orderlies. While forcibly restrained by the orderlies, Allen is given a powerful sedative by a nurse. While sedated, Allen's dreams play out the last several hours of his life. Five days later, Allen is ready for release from the hospital. Curtis arrives to pick Allen up, giving Allen the sad news that West has died.</p><p>Allen refuses to believe Curtis, until he is taken to the morgue, to see her body. Visibly shaken, Allen breaks down. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the Green Lantern convene a Justice League of America meeting, at their satellite headquarters. The four heroes agree to grant the Flash a formal leave of absence, to cope with the recent tragedy in his life. To their surprise, the Flash joins them. The Flash ask Superman to bring West back to life. Superman has no means of fulfilling the Flash's request. The Flash asks Wonder Woman to bring West Back to life.</p><p>Wonder Woman has no means of fulfilling the Flash's request. The Flash asks the Green Lantern to bring West back to life. The Green Lantern has no means of fulfilling the Flash's request. At the Green Lantern's refusal, the Flash grows violent, lashing out in a drug-fueled rage.

Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the Green Lantern close in on the Flash from all sides. The Flash easily avoids their attack, then races in super-speed circles around them. The centrifugal force the Flash generates begins to draw the air from Batman and the Green Lantern's lungs. To make matters worse, they, along with Wonder Woman, are being crushed against Superman's invulnerable body. Superman finally lays the Flash out.

While understanding of the personal tragedies motivating Allen's decision, Melanie stresses his responsibility, as the Flash, to Central City. Allen dons his Flash costume.

The Flash tracks Captain Boomerang back to an animal preserve, fashioned to appear as the Australian Outback. Under the pretense of surrender, Captain Boomerang snares the Flash in a boomerang-generated cage of electricity. After the Flash narrowly escapes a pair of boomerang-shaped explosives, Captain Boomerang flees. The Flash easily catches him. After putting up a token effort at fighting, Captain Boomerang is subdued by the Flash. The Flash interrogates Captain Boomerang, regarding the murder of Picture News reporter, Iris West Allen.</p><p>After Captain Boomerang swears innocence in the murder, The Flash departs, inexplicably without taking Captain Boomerang in for the jewelry theft. Detective Frank Curtis meets up with the Flash, in his civilian guise of police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, at police headquarters. Through self-hypnosis, Allen has made a breakthrough in the case. On the night of his wife's murder, at the masquerade ball, Allen was accosted by a man, dressed as the <a href=""/wesley-dodds/4005-9299/"" data-ref-id=""4005-9299"">Golden Age Sandman</a>. This man pressed his weapon into Allen's shoulder. Allen is now certain that that was the moment he was injected with a lethal dose of angel dust.</p><p>Curtis also has information, about West-Allen's alleged murderer, Clive Yorkin. On Death Row for murder, Yorkin had volunteered for the Nephron Project, an experimental program using aversion therapy to rehabilitate criminals. Yorkin, though, suffered from a rare case of dyslexia. Evidence suggests that the Nephron process had the exact opposite effect on Yorkin, in effect, making him a worse criminal. Unbeknownst to Allen and Curtis, the Nephron Process had other, unforeseen side-effects. Yorkin stalks the streets of Central City, skulking his way into a movie theater. There, in the darkened cinema, Yorkin draws the very life essence from a teenaged couple, enrapt in the film.</p><p>An usher chases Yorkin away. Curtis and Allen return to the West-Allen murder scene. A maid presents the two officers with the Golden Age Sandman costume, which had been discovered in the shrubbery, outside Whitlock Manor. Allen parts company with Curtis, when an alarm on his wrist watch goes off. Someone else is trying to steal the crimson pearls. En route to the burglary, the Flash passes the theater where Yorkin struck. Yorkin's teenage victims have aged to senility ,husks completely drained of life. The crimson pearls turn out to be bait, left by the Flash, to flush out members of his Rogues' Gallery he suspects were at the masquerade ball.</p><p>This time, it is Heat Wave who the Flash confronts.

As the Flash begins to slip away, his thoughts turn to his deceased wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West Allen. The psychic drain sours for Yorkin. Sickened, the monstrous brute flees. Having greatly recovered, the Flash sees to Yorkin's other victim, Heat Wave. The Flash's old foe is in a state of shock. The Flash rushes Heat Wave to the nearest hospital. The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, meets with detective Frank Curtis, at police headquarters.</p><p>Allen introduces Curtis to Melanie, a teenaged psychic. Melanie uses her extra-sensory powers to track down the hit man, who injected Allen with a lethal dose of drugs. With Melanie waiting in the car, Allen and Curtis storm the hit man's hotel room. Under interrogation, the hit man, Patterson, professes innocence in the murder of West-Allen. Patterson was only hired to kill Allen. Unbeknownst to Allen and Curtis, Patterson is being watched. Patterson receives a phone call. After the party on the other end of the line confirms that Patterson's visitors are police officers, the phone detonates.</p><p>Patterson is killed instantly, but Allen is fast enough to use his super-speed abilities to protect Curtis. Returning to the car, Allen and Curtis find a note from Melanie, who has departed. During her search for Patterson, Melanie kept picking up Allen's thoughts. Melanie journeys to Whitlock Manor, where West-Allen was murdered, to aid in finding her murderer, Yorkin. Melanie locates a shard of glass, containing Yorkin's psychic imprint, and sets out to track him down. On a routine patrol to roust out transients, two police officers stumble across Yorkin.</p><p>After calling for back-up, the officers give chase. Yorkin eludes them. Returning to their car to call it in, the officers are surprised by Yorkin, who springs up from the back seat, then drains away their life essences. A group of itinerants investigate the commotion, only to fall victim to Yorkin, as well. By the time police back-up arrives, Yorkin has left a half dozen corpses in his wake. The Flash learns about the attack, from a television broadcast. The Flash also learns, that Heat Wave has escaped from the hospital. The Flash assists the fire department in dousing a tenement building.</p><p>After rescuing a family, along with a pair of firefighters, the Flash investigates the source of the blaze. The Flash encounters Heat Wave, wildly firing his hotrod, searching for Yorkin. After disarming Heat Wave, the Flash carries him away. Unbeknownst to the Flash, Melanie has tracked Yorkin to that same building. The young girl barely has time to conceal herself, before Yorkin makes his presence known.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, ""<strong>Green Lantern vs Triclops: Three-Eyed Keeper of the Cave</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,19891,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3468991-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21jmfc1tkfgqbbqt%2B%21qsnl%21~~60_3.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",279,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",Death-Feast,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7955/', 'id': 7955, 'name': 'Alex Saviuk', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/alex-saviuk/4040-7955/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'artist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43258/', 'id': 43258, 'name': 'Frank Chiaramonte', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-chiaramonte/4040-43258/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-279-death-feast/4000-19891/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

A vigilante mob, hunting for deranged murderer, Clive Yorkin, corners a man in Central Cty Park. The vigilante mob opens fire, only to have the Flash rescue the man, at the last second, revealing him to be an innocent transient. The sober realization that they nearly executed an innocent man disperses the vigilante mob. A police helicopter gets a spotlight on Yorkin. The helicopter is attacked by Yorkin, who uses his strange power to fill the officers with fear, before draining away their life essences. Stray gunfire takes out the helicopter's rotors, causing it to crash. Yorkin is the only survivor.</p><p>Responding to radio calls, police are quick to surround Yorkin, but the brutish killer vaults a wall and escapes. Yorkin, though, has not escaped Melanie, a teenage girl with psychic powers, who is tracking Yorkin through a glass fragment, containing his psychic imprint. The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, returns to police headquarters. After a brief meeting with the police chief, Harvey Paulson, Allen does some background research on Yorkin. Allen turns up eleven prior addresses for Yorkin, and checks them all out, as the Flash. Melanie tracks Yorkin to a condemned neighborhood, dotted with sinkholes. Yorkin appears, quickly grabbing Melanie.</p><p>As Yorkin fills the girl with fear, Melanie finds she is unable to concentrate on her psychic bond with the Flash, and thus is unable to summon him to her aid. Nonetheless, the Flash arrives, checking on the last address on his list of Yorkin's prior residences. In a panic, Melanie broadcasts her own terror into the Flash, through their psychic link. Trying to keep his distance, the Flash attacks Yorkin with a long board. When Yorkin snaps the board, the Flash switches tactics, and pelts Yorkin with rocks. Unfortunately, Melanie gets in the line of fire, forcing the Flash to block his own attack. The impact of the rocks on the Flash's body hurls him into Yorkin and Melanie.</p><p>All three tumble down into one of the sinkholes. The Flash, still virtually paralyzed by Melanie's terror, is helpless before Yorkin. Getting a firm grip on the Flash, Yorkin begins draining away the Scarlet Speedster's life essence. Fading fast, the Flash sees an image of his deceased wife, Picture News reporter<a href=""/iris-west-allen/4005-9977/"" data-ref-id=""4005-9977"">, Iris West Allen</a>. The image of his wife gives Flash the strength to rally, which sours Yorkin's psychic feed. Yorkin breaks contact and attempts to scale the walls of the sinkhole. Unable to find purchase, Yorkin falls back. The ground gives way beneath Yorkin, as the Earth swallows him whole. The Flash manages to get Melanie to safety before the entire sinkhole collapses in on itself.</p><p>Melanie had locked onto the Flash's vision of Iris and used her psychic powers to feed the image back to him on a continuous loop, for him to draw strength from. The Flash gets Melody home. With Yorkin dead, the Flash has finally avenged the murder of his wife.

While Allen is processing this news, he hears a gunshot. Curtis has been gunned down by drug dealers. Allen races to Curtis' rescue, as the Flash. As the gunsels move in on Curtis, he suddenly bolts up and begins shooting. Curtis manages to kill three of his assailants, before he is cut down by machine gun fire.

As the Flash sinks from view, Professor Zoom taunts him with his knowledge of the identity of the Flash's wife's murderer. By vibrating his body at super-human speed, into intangibility, the Flash is able to survive the molten heat of the Earth's depths. The heat reaches such a high degree, that the heavy matter boots literally melt off the Flash's feet.

The Scarlet Speedster forcibly grabs Paulson, in front of his family, and races him back to Central City. Though Paulson admits to his role in the heroin smuggling ring, he points the finger at another man, known only as ""ZYX"", as the true ringleader. At the precinct house, the Flash turns Paulson over to the authorities.</p><p>Paulson denies the Flash's accusations, but the Flash is quick to offer up a recording of his conversation with Paulson, while they were en route to Central City. Paulson erupts in fury, as he is led away in handcuffs. The Green Lantern checks in on the Flash, as he is leaving police headquarters. The Flash rudely brushes the Green Lantern off. Fearing that the Flash is suffering from another drug-fueled bout of insanity, the Green Lantern uses his ring to cage the Flash. The Flash easily steps through the bars of the power ring constructed prison, then reveals himself to be Professor Zoom. After belting the Green Lantern to the ground, Professor Zoom flees.

Watching the Flash's demise is Professor Zoom, the sinister Reverse Flash. Professor Zoom watches a security tape recording of Iris West Allen's murder, before keeping a scheduled rendezvous at the Powdered Milk factory, with his heroin ring. Having abandoned his life in the 25th Century, Professor Zoom has discovered that he has taken to the life of a criminal, and makes plans to take over the heroin trade. Leaving the factory for his base of operations, Professor Zoom tasks his hirelings to bring him a woman whose features favor West Allen's.</p><p>Professor Zoom instructs a cosmetic surgeon to alter this woman's appearance, without her consent, until she is a dead ringer for West Allen. Having seen to his operations, Professor Zoom, out of sheer vanity, makes an historical record of his actions. Upon first arriving in the 20th Century, Professor Zoom approached West Allen, and professed his love for her. West Allen laughed in Professor Zoom's face. Professor Zoom issued her a 24-hour ultimatum, to love him or die, then hypnotically wiped her memory of their encounter. At the Whitlock Masquerade Ball, Professor Zoom approached West Allen, asking for her answer. West Allen slapped him in the face.</p><p>After hypnotically erasing her memory once again, Professor Zoom moved off, when the Green Lantern asked to dance with West Allen. A short time later, Professor Zoom followed West Allen, and the Flash, when they isolated themselves upstairs, in the Whitlock Manor. The Flash had been dosed with a lethal amount of heroin, and was beginning to feel it's effects. West Allen went to get the Flash a glass of water, and ran headlong into deranged murderer, Clive Yorkin. Moving so fast as to be invisible to the naked eye, Professor Zoom vibrated his hand into West Allen's head, and scrambled her brain, killing her. When the Flash staggered into the room, in response to West Allen's screams, Professor Zoom, still invisible, forcibly hurled Yorkin out the window.</p><p>The Flash succumbed to the heroin in his system, believing that Yorkin had murdered his wife. While Professor Zoom sleeps, a powerful tremor runs through the powdered milk factory. So great are the vibrations that the entire structure collapses into ruins. Professor Zoom awakens to the Flash's voice. The Flash now knows that Professor Zoom is West Allen's true murderer. The Flash survived the detonation of the Cosmic Treadmill by vibrating his molecules at super-human speed, into intangibility, then dispersing them, before the explosion could strike him. Exercising his complete control over every molecule of his body, the Flash then put himself back together, though the process took several hours.</p><p>After dismantling Professor Zoom's heroin operation, the Flash has come to exact vengeance on his arch-nemesis. Professor Zoom flees, with the Flash in hot pursuit. Racing across the Pacific Ocean, Professor Zoom kicks up enough sea water, in his wake, to knock the Flash off his feet. Professor Zoom reaches his Time-Tripper, with plans to return to his native 25th Century. The Flash, though, is right on his heels. After mercilessly beating Professor Zoom senseless, the Flash activates the Time-Tripper, to return Professor Zoom to the proper authorities, in his time.</p><p>Professor Zoom, though, has rigged the controls to only work for him. Instead of traveling 500 years into the future, to Professor Zoom's time, the Time-Tripper begins moving, rapidly, backwards in time. With the Time-Tripper programmed to travel beyond the beginning of time itself, the Flash makes a desperate gamble, and leaps out into the time stream, leaving Professor Zoom to his doom.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Note: </strong>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, <strong>Batman and Professor Plutonium.</strong></p>",,,,,,,False,20212,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469022-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21ree88gwmzobbpwgflvyq%21~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",283,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56306/', 'id': 56306, 'name': 'Pacific Ocean', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pacific-ocean/4020-56306/'}]",Flashback,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6609/', 'id': 6609, 'name': 'Don Heck', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/don-heck/4040-6609/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43258/', 'id': 43258, 'name': 'Frank Chiaramonte', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-chiaramonte/4040-43258/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'editor, penciler, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-283-flashback/4000-20212/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The Trickster envelops the Flash in a mixed cloud of nitrous oxide, helium, and other chemicals. The Flash begins laughing uncontrollably, as he rises into the air. With the Flash incapacitated, the Trickster resumes his robbery of wealthy industrialist, P. J. Sloane's apartment. Through a few super-speed maneuvers, the Flash manages to disperse the Trickster's cloud. The Flash catches the Trickster in a super-speed generated whirlwind, just as the Trickster is exiting Sloane's apartment. The Trickster attempts to flee on his Tri-Jet Cycle, only to be thwarted when it runs out of gas.</p><p>Luckily for the Trickster, one of the stolen chess pieces, he took from Sloane, falls out of his loot bag, striking the Flash. The Flash is moving at such high velocity that the impact fells him. Upon recovery, the Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen reports for work. Allen meets the new chief of police, Darryl Frye. In his laboratory, Allen finds undercover narcotics detective, Frank Curtis, waiting for him. Curtis has garnered the phone number of an available single woman for Allen. Despite the passage of a year since his wife's death, Allen still finds it too soon to begin dating again. After turning down a lunch invitation from his assistant, Patty Spivot, Allen suddenly remembers that he's expected to meet a moving company at his home.</p><p>Allen, as the Flash, rushes home to pack up his belongings, in preparation for the movers. After work, Allen drives out to his new home, in Utopia Towers. Upon pulling into the parking lot, Allen narrowly avoids hitting a traveling toy salesman. Heading to his apartment, Allen meets his new neighbors, the icy, but astonishingly beautiful, Fiona Webb, and the jocular Mack Nathan. Allen is invited to dinner at Nathan's. At super-human speed, Allen unpacks his belongings and arranges all of his furniture, before heading over to Nathan's for dinner. Allen is introduced to Nathan's son, Troy.</p><p>Over dinner, Allen learns that Nathan is a S.T.A.R. Labs scientist, working on an experimental method of nuclear propulsion. Their conversation is interrupted by the sounds of Troy's latest purchase, a robot toy soldier. Late that night, the robot toy soldier attempts to break into Nathan's safe. Nathan destroys the robot toy soldier, with a hammer. Nathan and Allen carpool to work. While discussing the incident, Allen realizes that the traveling toy salesman must have been the Trickster. Suddenly, the remains of the robot toy soldier begin emitting tear gas. Nathan loses consciousness, and control of the car, driving it over a cliffside.</p><p>Allen, as the Flash, stops the car's descent, with a super-speed generated updraft. Bounding off the hood of Nathan's car, the Flash literally runs on the microscopic smoke particles trailing from the Trickster's Tri-Jet Cycle's exhaust. The Flash grabs ahold of the exhaust ports of the Trickster's Tri-Jet Cycle. The Trickster tries to burn the Flash off, but the Flash merely vibrates his molecular structure into intangibility. The Flash dismounts the Trickster, then beats him into unconsciousness, on the ground. The Flash resumes his civilian identity, before Nathan returns to consciousness, then relays the tale of the Trickster's defeat to Nathan.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Wonder Woman in ""<strong>The Borrower</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,20358,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469027-%24%28kgrhquoknifjwf6mqwpbsb1r4%29t5%21~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",285,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""If, at First, You Don't Succeed...!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58442/', 'id': 58442, 'name': ""Trickster's Gadgets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tricksters-gadgets/4055-58442/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6609/', 'id': 6609, 'name': 'Don Heck', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/don-heck/4040-6609/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43258/', 'id': 43258, 'name': 'Frank Chiaramonte', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-chiaramonte/4040-43258/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41457/', 'id': 41457, 'name': 'Len Wein', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/len-wein/4040-41457/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-285-if-at-first-you-dont-succeed/4000-20358/,1980-02-14,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Allen investigates, as the Flash. Arriving on the scene, the Flash sees a rainbow illuminating the roof of the Centrex Art Museum. Inside the museum, the Flash encounters two security guards, incapacitated by grief. The Flash encounters the culprit behind their condition, the Rainbow Raider. The Flash manages to dodge the Rainbow Raider's attack, then tackles him to the floor. The Rainbow Raider counters by reflecting black beams, from his goggles, off a mirror, into the Flash's back. With the Flash momentarily stunned, the Rainbow Raider escapes.</p><p>Central City police officers fare no better in stopping the Rainbow Raider from escaping. Inside the museum, the officers note that the Rainbow Raider has signed his name, in place of one of the stolen paintings. The Flash races home. The black beams that struck him have bled out every trace of color in both his body and uniform, leaving him white as chalk. In his secret lair, on the outskirts of Central City, the Rainbow Raider reflects on his past. The Rainbow Raider, as Roy G. Bivolo, had been a child prodigy, with a talent for painting. He was also completely color-blind. His inability to see colors ruined his artistic aspirations.</p><p>His father, a gifted optometrist, vowed to find away to compensate for his son's condition. On his death bed, Bivolo's father presented him with a pair of ""Prisma-Goggles"". Bivolo thought the googles would finally allow him to see colors, but found that his world was still painted in shades of grey. Accidentally brushing his fingers over a trigger, Bivolo was startled to see the goggles emit a rainbow. Bivolo soon discovered that he could ride the rainbow. Pouring over his father's notes, Bivolo learned that the Prisma-Goggles could also emit any single color of the rainbow, affecting the corresponding emotional state of his victims. Blue would instill overwhelming sadness. Red would instill murderous fury.</p><p>Bivolo realizes that the ""compensation"" his father offered was not regarding his eyesight, but his lifestyle. Bivolo becomes the Rainbow Raider, and sets out to steal the great works of art, solely out of spite. If he cannot enjoy them due to his color-blindedness, then no one else shall gaze upon them either. Fiona Webb delivers a piece of mail to Allen. Still chalk-white, Allen has Webb slide the missive under his door, so as not to reveal his condition to her. Allen covers his body in flesh tone make-up, then dyes his hair blonde. Though his appearance is a little off, it's normal enough looking to allow him to go to work.</p><p>Arriving an hour and ten minutes late draws a lecture form Allen's new boss, police captain Darryl Frye. Allen overhears a television broadcast regarding the opening of the new Skytop Art Gallery. Realizing that it's a perfect target for the Rainbow Raider, Allen goes into action, as the Flash. Sure enough, the Rainbow Raider has struck again. His red beams of rage have whipped the patrons up into a murderous fury, causing a full blown riot. Racing up the side of a building and onto the Rainbow Raider's rainbow bridge, the Flash closes on his quarry. The Rainbow Raider blinds the Flash with a dazzling display of light, causing the Flash to fall from the rainbow bridge.</p><p>The Flash plummets into a junk yard, saving himself by vibrating his molecules into intangibility. As the Flash exits the car he fell through, he notices that his body is no longer chalk-white. Instead it has become an emerald green, the same color as the car. Testing out a theory, the Flash vibrates through a yellow school bus, and adds that color to his hue. Vibrating through multiple vehicles, the Flash picks up all the colors of the rainbow. Returning his molecular vibrations to normal, the Flash returns to his normal pigmentation. After dodging the Rainbow Raider's attack, the Flash buries his foe in the junkyard, before removing the Rainbow Raider's weaponized goggles.

After rendering laboratory assistant, Patty Spivot, unconscious, Doctor Alchemy lays claim to a dyrithum bullet- proof vest. Having witnessed Doctor Alchemy's assault on his assistant, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, goes into action, as the Flash. Doctor Alchemy's men greet the Flash with a hail of gunfire. Not wishing to see the laboratory destroyed, the Flash opts to catch all the bullets, rather then vibrate his molecules into intangibility. After taking out the two gunmen, the Flash goes after Doctor Alchemy. To bar his pursuit, Doctor Alchemy uses his Philosopher's Stone to create a wall of dry ice in the Flash's path.</p><p>The Flash crashes through the barrier without losing a step. As the Flash closes on Doctor Alchemy, he is suddenly overwhelmed by carbon monoxide poisoning, and lapses into unconsciousness. Upon recovery,the Flash, as Allen, returns to the laboratory. Allen spends the rest of the work day pondering the return of Doctor Alchemy, and what that means for Allen's friend, Al Desmond. After work, Allen meets with Desmond's wife, Rita. Desmond's wife is visibly upset. Desmond arrives, and offers an alibi for his whereabouts, during Doctor Alchemy's assault on the forensics laboratory. Desmond's wife, however, doesn't back his alibi. The police arrive, and take Desmond into custody.</p><p>In Desmond's garage, the police find the stolen dyrithum bullet-proof vest. En route back to police headquarters, Allen, as the Flash, prevents a taxi cab from crashing through a store front. The cab's passenger is one of Allen's new neighbors, the mysterious Fiona Webb. The Flash escorts Webb to her destination, coincidentally, also police headquarters. Arriving at police headquarters, the Flash finds the building emitting a blinding light. The very air within police headquarters has been blended with sodium, creating the dazzling glare. The Flash races to Desmond's cell, and finds the iron bars transformed into a much softer metal, gold. Desmond is gone.</p><p>The Flash runs down Desmond, as Doctor Alchemy, in a nearby park. The Flash incapacitates Doctor Alchemy, then beats him into the ground. ""Doctor Alchemy"", however, is revealed to be a hapless innocent, who was paid to put the costume on. The real Doctor Alchemy has made good his escape. In a cave on the outskirts of Central City, Desmond, chained to the wall, is held captive. His captor, Doctor Alchemy, reveals himself to be another man, also named Al Desmond. This man bears neither resemblance nor kinship with Desmond. With Desmond framed for Doctor Alchemy's crimes, the other Al Desmond relishes his moment of triumph.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Batman in ""<strong>Catman on the Prowl</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,20499,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469032-%24_3.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",287,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-40924/', 'id': 40924, 'name': 'Keystone City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keystone-city/4020-40924/'}]",Dr. Alchemy and Mr. Desmond!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6609/', 'id': 6609, 'name': 'Don Heck', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/don-heck/4040-6609/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43258/', 'id': 43258, 'name': 'Frank Chiaramonte', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-chiaramonte/4040-43258/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41457/', 'id': 41457, 'name': 'Len Wein', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/len-wein/4040-41457/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-287-dr-alchemy-and-mr-desmond/4000-20499/,1980-04-10,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Captain Darryl Frye brings the officers of the Central City Police Department up to date on Desmond's criminal alter-ego, Doctor Alchemy. The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, joins them to discuss Doctor Alchemy's weapon, the Philosopher's Stone. After work, Allen calls on his neighbor, the mysterious beauty, Fiona Webb. Refusing to open the door for Allen, Webb informs him that she has filed a formal complaint with the police, regarding his continued harassment. Allen is called away from Webb's door by Troy Nathan, the son of another of Allen's neighbors, Mack Nathan.</p><p>Troy draws Allen's attention to a television newscast. The S.T.A.R Labs facility that Troy's father works at has undergone a terrifying transformation. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Arriving on the scene, the Flash batters down the sealed doors, allowing the scientists to evacuate the building. The Flash aids in the evacuation, clearing the skyscraper, floor by floor. Finally, the Flash comes across Nathan, and his laboratory assistant, on the top floor. Nathan informs the Flash that the building's steel skeleton has been transformed into industrial rubber. With the building clear, the Flash races around and around the facility, creating a powerful updraft, that keeps the structure erect.</p><p>After over a quarter of an hour has passed, the building's infrastructure reverts to normal. An exhausted Flash learns that Doctor Alchemy conducted a robbery, a mere three blocks away, during the crisis. In a cave on the outskirts of Central City, a paralyzed Desmond listens to the words of the new Doctor Alchemy. This man, too, is also named Al Desmond. Astonishingly, the two Desmonds are astral twins. Though thousands of miles apart, both men were born on the same day, at the same time, to parents with the exact same names. Both men grew up with a deep fascination for chemistry. Both men were plagued by powerful criminal urges.</p><p>While Desmond channeled his criminal desires into two costumed alter-egos, first as Mister Element, then later as Doctor Alchemy, Desmond's twin sought therapy. The two Desmonds were also strangely connected by their criminal impulses. When Desmond was acting as either Mister Element, or Doctor Alchemy, his twin found it easy to walk the straight and narrow. During the periods of time when Desmond was considered to be rehabilitated, his twin was overwhelmed with the need to commit criminal acts. When at last the therapy and pharmaceuticals failed to keep his criminal urges in check, Desmond's twin used their psychic link to unearth the Philosopher Stone's hiding place.</p><p>Donning the guise of Doctor Alchemy, Desmond's twin set out to frame him for the new crimes of Doctor Alchemy. Even going so far as to hypnotize Desmond's wife, Rita, so that she would not back up Desmond's alibi. A mound of sulfur appears in Central City Park. The Flash arrives to investigate the situation. Having drawn the Flash out, Doctor Alchemy uses the Philosopher's Stone to transform the water molecules making up the Flash's body into water vapor. As the Flash begins to rapidly evaporate, Doctor Alchemy reveals his true face to the Flash. Using his complete molecular control of his body, the Flash begins agitating his molecules to generate heat.</p><p>The Flash collides with another cloud. The Flash's warm mass coupled with the cold mass of the cloud, generates a storm cloud, that pulls the Flash's molecules together. Then, astoundingly, it literally rains the Flash. Now knowing that his friend is actually innocent, the Flash sets out to track down Doctor Alchemy. Doctor Alchemy returns to his hidden cave lair to find Desmond gone. In a seedy hotel, Desmond suits up in his old Mister Element costume.

The Bad... And The Unexpected!</ins></h3><p>Doctor Alchemy tracks Al Desmond to a warehouse, on Central City's lower west side. Desmond, in his guise as Mister Element, fires a bolt of niobium acid at Doctor Alchemy. Having narrowly avoided the acid, Doctor Alchemy squares off against Mister Element. Doctor Alchemy uses his Philosopher's Stone to ignite the oxygen in the air. Mister Element counters, using his Element Gun to erect a shield of asbestos. Doctor Alchemy burns through the shield with super-heated carbon. Mister Element, though, having transformed the wood beneath his feet into titanium, has escaped into the sewer system.</p><p>Having set the entire warehouse ablaze, during his combat with Mister Element, Doctor Alchemy flees the scene. The Flash aids fire fighters in extinguishing the blaze. The Flash manages to rescue four fire fighters, trapped within the warehouse. A fifth imperiled fire fighter, though, remains unseen by the Flash. This man is rescued by Mister Element, who surrounds the fire fighter in a bubble of oxygen, surrounded by a bubble of nitrogen. The Flash confronts Desmond's wife, Rita, regarding Desmond's whereabouts.</p><p>While the Flash scours Central City for Desmond, Doctor Alchemy uses his Philosopher's Stone to stop a train. From the train, Doctor Alchemy steals one hundred pounds of nuclear waste material. The Flash receives a tip from Rita, regarding Desmond's possible whereabouts. Mister Element tracks Doctor Alchemy to an abandoned salt mine. Upon entry, Mister Element is laid low by crystal fists, which grow out from the walls. Mister Element awakens, suspended over a pit of nuclear waste material. Doctor Alchemy intends to uses his Philosopher's Stone to convert the nuclear waste materials into a new element, ""Desmondium"".</p><p>This element will allow Doctor Alchemy to enslave humanity through mental domination. ""Mister Element"" begins spinning at super-human speed, revealing himself to be the Flash. Doctor Alchemy uses his Philosopher's Stone to transform the Flash's molecular structure into Cavorite, an anti-gravity element. The Flash immediately floats away, vibrating his molecules into intangibility, to avoid being smashed against the cavern ceiling. The real Mister Element enters the cavern, and fires a bolt of molten zirconium at Doctor Alchemy.</p><p>Using his Philosopher's Stone, Doctor Alchemy converts the zirconium into a spray of gold dust. As the Flash rises into space, he shifts his atomic structure from matter to anti-matter. The resultant conversion destroys the Cavorite molecules, restoring the Flash to normal. The Flash storms the cavern, and quickly beats Doctor Alchemy into unconsciousness. After freeing Mister Element, the two men take Doctor Alchemy to the nearest police precinct house. Meanwhile, Fiona Webb, the Flash's new neighbor, in his civilian guise as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, files a formal complaint against Allen, accusing Allen of planning to murder her.</p><h3><ins>Firestorm Is Back In Town!</ins></h3><p>Firestorm exuberantly proclaims his return to New York City. Drawn to a potential boat collision, Firestorm uses his powers to form a bridge, allowing the speedboat to pass over the sailboat. Firestorm then brings the speedboat to a stop, before firing off a flare to alert the harbor patrol. Firestorm flies to Jamaica, Queens, where he separates back into his component parts, Professor Martin Stein and Ronald Raymond. Raymond ducks into the shadows, as Stein tries to make sense of his current whereabouts. As Stein has no conscious knowledge of his time spent as part of Firestorm, he believes himself to be suffering from drunken blackouts.</p><p>Raymond decides to come clean about their shared life as Firestorm. Raymond escorts Stein back to his apartment, to tell his tale. Raymond, looking to draw Doreen Day's attentions away from Cliff Carmichael, decided to join a protest group, opposed to nuclear power. Raymond went with the group to the Hudson Power Plant. When the group breaks into the plant, Raymond began to have second thoughts regarding his participation in the group's activities. Raymond is beaten into unconsciousness, to serve as the scapegoat for the group's plan to blow up the plant. Having seen the group on the security monitors, Stein confronted the group, only to also be beaten unconscious. Raymond awakened just as the bomb detonated.</p><p><ins><strong>Firestorm826's Panel-by-Panel Story Summary (Spoiler Alert)</strong></ins></p><p>A peaceful enough evening in Queens, New York. For most people here-abouts, the day is over. For some - - cats, for example - - it’s just beginning. For cats, and for a few others, too…</p><p>“Mrroww!” goes an alley cat. She hops down from a fence onto some garbage cans, looking for something to nibble on. Suddenly…</p><p>SHROOM! A streak of light flashes past her. She leaps up, startled. “MMROWW!” she blurts. The streak whooshes on, pulling a slipstream of wind over the startled kitty. She cowers in a trash can, swiping out with a paw. “Psstt-ft!” she hisses.</p><p>The streak of light continues zooming at street level, then abruptly turns straight up to soar vertically high into the sky above the streets. At the top of the streak of light is…Firestorm, the Nuclear Man!</p><p>Arms extended triumphantly, he grins widely as he gains altitude. “Look out, New York! Firestorm is back in town!” Ronnie Raymond yells happily. Professor Martin Stein watches as Ronnie guides them through aerial maneuvers that would make a fighter pilot jealous.</p><p>“Ronald, really, must you be so exuberant?” Stein asks. Ronnie barrels back down to rooftop level and banks towards the waterfront. “If that means happy, Professor, you bet!” he answers, asking, “How else am I supposed to feel after being made a member of the JLA?”</p><p>Stein nods. “I admit it’s cause for celebration, but…” Stein says. Ronnie interjects. “But, nothing! Don’t you get it, Professor? They accepted me!” Ronnie says with a smile, “To them, I’m not just a dumb teenager, I’m a real bona fide - - huh?”</p><p>Ronnie’s thoughts are interrupted by trouble in the Harbor down below. “Look down there, Professor Stein!” Ronnie cries out, “That motorboat’s out of control - - and it’s on a collision course with that sailboat!”</p><p>VVRROOOM! The speedboat races on as a young boy struggles with the controls. A young lady on the sailboat pulls hard on her mainsail’s rope, trying to shift course. “I’ll have to drop you off at your digs a little late, Professor,” Ronnie says, “Like my pal Superman would say - - this is a job for Firestorm!” He chuckles as he dives down to sea level.</p><p>PZOOM! Ronnie fires a restructuring burst at the water between the two boats. “Ronald, your nuclear blasts are overshooting the motorboat!” Stein observes. “Wrong, Professor, this is working just the way I want it to!” Ronnie explains, “My nuclear blasts are rearranging the water’s atomic structure…making the water solid, and changing its shape...”</p><p>Guided by Ronnie’s atomic beams, water forms itself into an ice bridge that rises over the sailboat. The speedboat races up the ice bridge, passes safely over the sailboat, and lands in the water on the other side! “Pretty neat trick, wouldn’t you say?” Ronnie asks, admiring his handiwork, “Nobody gets hurt and everybody has a good time.”</p><p>Down below, water flows over the ice bridge from the speedboat’s wake, drenching the poor girl on the sailboat. “Yes, Ronald, but the motorboat is still running wild,” Stein warns. Ronnie turns to pursue the speeding boat. “I’ll get to it, Professor, I’ll get to it. Give me a break, will ya?” Ronnie answers, adding, “The poor kid trying to drive this thing looks frightened half to death. Probably snuck the boat out, and now he’s sorry he ever got into this mess.”</p><p>Ronnie fires a transforming burst into the water just ahead of the speedboat, creating a giant net that stretches across its path. The speedboat plows into the net and slowly comes to a stop. “Take it easy, pal. Your big night’s over,” Ronnie calls down to the scared boy at the wheel. He lands next to him on the bobbing boat. “Th-Thanks, M-Mister,” the boy says nervously. “Shucks, forget it. What’re super-heroes for, I ask you?” Ronnie answers.</p><p>He aims a hand into the sky and launches atomic bursts that create bright signal flares floating over the speedboat. “Once the Harbor Patrol spots these fireworks, they’ll be out to pick you up in no time.” Ronnie leaps skyward, trailing a bright line of atomic light behind him. “Wowwww,” gasps the boy.</p><p>Not long after, in one of the less savory parts of Jamaica, Queens - - a trail of glittering energy disappears between two buildings - - and there, in a shadowed alleyway, the unique transformation occurs that separates the Nuclear Man into his component parts…Ronnie Raymond, your basic New York teenager. Professor Martin Stein, your basic discredited physicist.</p><p>Professor Stein stumbles against a trash can, grabbing at his head, disoriented from the transformation. “…another beer, bartender, if you don’t - - mind?” he mumbles. He looks back and forth quickly, confused by his surroundings. “Oh Heaven! It’s happened again! Another of those terrible blackouts!” he exclaims, “A moment ago, I was in a bar on Parsons Boulevard, I’m sure of it.”</p><p>He kneels to the street, growing upset, unaware of Ronnie standing nearby behind him. “So how did I get here? How many hours have I lost this time?” he asks, continuing, “If only I knew what happened to me during the blackouts - - not knowing is crucifying me! Because of the blackouts, I lost my job as Director of the Hudson Nuclear Facility, I lost my reputation, my friends…” He starts to cry softly, overcome by his situation. “…I’ve lost everything…everything…” he sobs.</p><p>Ronnie stands next to a building, concealed by the shadows as he watches the Professor. “I - - I never told the Professor what happened to us, how we become Firestorm, because I was afraid he wouldn’t let it go on,” he thinks, “But I can’t just let him live like this…not anymore…Even if it means the end of Firestorm, I’ve got to tell him.”</p><p>Ronnie steps out of the shadows. “Professor…Professor Stein?” he calls out. Stein jumps up, startled by the voice behind him. “Who’s there?” he answers nervously, “I don’t have any money, I swear I don’t!” Ronnie cautiously approaches as Stein cowers against a building. “Professor, I’m not going to rob you,” Ronnie tells him, asking, “Is there someplace we can talk? My name’s Ronnie Raymond, and I’ve got a little story to tell you…”</p><p>Shortly after, Ronnie and Professor Stein arrive at Stein’s apartment where Ronnie begins to tell an unbelievable story.</p><p>“…So it all started a few months ago, right after you finished building the Hudson Nuclear Plant,” Ronnie explains. Stein asks, “You know about the Hudson Plant?” Ronnie walks to the couch as Stein slumps into a chair. “Professor, I was there. That’s how all this got started. Look, let me begin with Cliff Carmichael.”</p><p>Ronnie takes a seat on the couch as Stein listens. “Carmichael is a classmate of mine at Bradley High, and ever since I transferred to the school, he’s been ribbing me about my grades…” Ronnie explains.</p><p>Ronnie recalls playing a game of pick-up football on the school’s snow-covered field. Ronnie catches a long pass for a touchdown. “Say, hero, that was some catch!” Cliff taunts, “Two bits says you can’t do it again while chewing gum!”</p><p>Ronnie remembers getting frustrated with Cliff. “Ordinarily, I wouldn’t let that sort of thing bother me, but there was this girl there, Doreen Day…” Ronnie explains to Stein.</p><p>“Quit riding me, Carmichael, or I’ll turn your glasses into contact lenses!” Ronnie answers Cliff. “Ah, yes, the threat of violence. A typical reaction of the intellectual primitive,” Cliff answers smugly, walking away with Doreen as they both laugh.</p><p>“You see, I hated the idea that Doreen might think I was just a dumb jock…I guess I wanted to impress her,” Ronnie tells Stein, “…So I did something really dumb…That night, there was a news report on the TV about a group called the Coalition to Protest Atomic Power…They were demonstrating at your plant - - and suddenly, it seemed like just the way to prove myself to Doreen. I went down and joined, meeting their leader, a guy named Earhart…”</p><p>Stein listens intently, trying to piece it all together. “Right off I should have known they weren’t a reputable group…They told me about some crackpot plan they had to sneak into the Plant; that night, we went there…and we broke in,” Ronnie explains.</p><p>Ronnie recalls being shocked as the group cut through the Plant’s security fence. “Uh, listen, isn’t this against the law?” he asks Earhart. “Yeah, so?” Earhart answers as two of his men carry a heavy wooden crate through the fence. “So? Maybe you better tell me what we’re doing here?” Ronnie asks quickly. “We’re gonna make an example out of this atomic joint, kid - - by blowing it sky high! And you’re gonna be the patsy!” Earhart snarls at him, stunning Ronnie unconscious with a punch to the back of his skull!</p><p>“I guess that’s when you arrived, Professor,” Ronnie explains, “You’d been working late, and you’d seen us on the security monitors…”</p><p>Earhart and his men dragged Ronnie into the Plant. Professor Stein opened the control room door to confront them in the hallway. “You, there! Release that boy and get out before I call the police!” Stein calls to them. Earhart rushes up to Stein, snarling, “You should’ve called the cops first, Pops, too bad!” CHUNK! Earhart punches Stein across the jaw, knocking him unconscious! Earhart’s thugs quickly open the wooden crate and begin to set the dynamite charges.</p><p>“Leave ‘em together over by the atomic pile!” Earhart orders his men, “When that dynamite blows - - there won’t be enough left of both of ‘em to make one man! Haha!”</p><p>Ronnie slowly regains consciousness as Earhart and his gang escape. “Wow, my head! Feels like and elephant did a tap dance on my skull!” he thinks He looks next to him and sees Stein’s motionless form. Just feet away, the dynamite sits with a ticking time fuse! “Where am - - Hey!

Webb accuses Allen of plotting her murder. The desk sergeant is reluctant to take action, as Allen is one of their own. The Flash places Doctor Alchemy into police custody. Overhearing Webb's accusation, the Flash asks to hear Webb's side of the story. While they're speaking, they come under attack by a flock of carrier pigeons, carrying miniature explosives. The Flash vibrates himself, and Webb, at super-human speed, into intangibility. After the initial blast wave passes harmlessly through them, the Flash contains the shock waves, to protect the innocent bystanders.</p><p>Inspecting one of the pigeons, the Flash discovers a miniature camera, and a relay system to control the birds. The Flash opts not to scour the area for the perpetrator, choosing instead to use this opportunity to clear Allen's good name. The Flash races Webb to Allen's apartment. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash is able to create the illusion not only of himself appearing at the same time as his alter-ego, but also carry on a conversation. In this way, the Flash proves to Webb that Allen was home, sleeping, during the attack. Webb, though, is undeterred in her certainty over Allen's guilt, suggesting that he merely hired someone else to do his dirty work.</p><p>Crestfallen, the Flash escorts Webb home. The Flash, as Allen, runs Webb's fingerprints through the law enforcement data base, and comes up empty. A fellow forensics scientist suggests that Webb's information is protected by a ""Code-7"", meaning that the Federal Government, itself, is protecting her information. Allen types the information back into the computer, then vibrates his way inside the computer itself. Allen chases the computer impulses, following their electrons to Webb's protected information. Allen discovers that Webb's real name is Beverly Lewis. Allen asks his neighbors, the Nathans, to keep an eye on Webb. Allen, as the Flash, looks into Webb's life, as Lewis, in Idaho.</p><p>Sorting through town records on Lewis, the Flash is accosted by King Faraday. After ascertaining that the Flash is, indeed, the Flash, Faraday identifies himself as a government agent. Faraday reveals that Lewis witnessed syndicate boss, Ross Malverk, murder an associate. For her testimony against Malverk, Lewis was placed in the Witness Protection Program. To insure her past would never catch up to her, Lewis volunteered to be brainwashed, so that no trace of her previous identity would exist in her mind. Faraday informs the Flash that Malverk has escaped from prison, and hired a professional killer, a master of disguise known as Saber-Tooth, to take Lewis out.</p><p>Faraday shows the Flash film strips of Malverk's trial, so that the Flash knows what Malverk looks like. Webb sits down to dinner with the Nathans. When the elder Nathan excuses himself to get more wine, he is beaten and bound, in the kitchen, by Saber-Tooth. ""Nathan"" returns to the table, aiming the bottle of wine at Webb. As he pops the cork, a jet of flame is released. The Flash pushes Webb to safety, then takes out Saber-Tooth. Webb unties the real Nathan, then returns home. There she finds Allen waiting for her, gun drawn, prepared to murder her.</p><h3><ins>The Secret History Of The Nuclear Man</ins></h3><p>Ronald Raymond continues to recount, to Professor Martin Stein, the story of how they became Firestorm, the Nuclear Man. Raymond had broken into the Hudson Power Plant, along with a group of protestors. Learning that the protestors actually planned to blow up the plant, Raymond threatened to contact the police. Raymond was beaten into unconsciousness. When Stein confronted the protestors, having seen them on the security monitors, he, too, was beaten unconscious. Raymond regained consciousness, just as the protestor's explosives detonated.</p><p>When an experimental reactor exploded, Raymond and Stein were bathed in radiation, which caused them to fuse together into one being. Raymond quickly realized that he could actually see the atomic structure of objects, and could actually alter them on a molecular level. Raymond fashioned himself a costume, and dubbed himself ""Firestorm, the Nuclear Man"". As New York's newest super-hero, Firestorm battled against Multiplex, Killer Frost and the Hyena. After teaming up with Superman against Killer Frost, Firestorm was invited to join the Justice League of America.</p><p>As Stein was unconscious when he and Raymond were first transformed into Firestorm, Stein has no memory of his activities as Firestorm. Stein believes that his ""blackouts"" were caused by excessive drinking. At the end of Raymond's tale, Stein bursts into laughter over the ludicrousness of the story. In anger, Raymond triggers the transformation into Firestorm. Stein's consciousness suggests to Raymond that he photograph their transformation, to provide proof to Stein of the veracity of Raymond's tale. Firestorm complies. Upon seeing the photographs, Stein is relieved to learn that he isn't having a nervous breakdown. Stein and Raymond forge a new friendship.</p><p><ins><strong>Firestorm826's Panel-by-Panel Story Summary (Spoiler Alert)</strong></ins></p><p>A shabby apartment in a rundown neighborhood in Astoria, Queens, might not seem, at first glance, a place for weighty revelations to be made…But, at second glance…</p><p>“I must be mad, sitting here listening to this,” Professor Martin Stein sighs. He sits at his kitchen table, resting his forehead on his hand as he listens to Ronnie Raymond. “You come to me with some wild story to explain the blackouts that have ruined my career…You seem to know me…but I don’t know you!” Stein adds in frustration, trying to understand. “I’ll get to it, Professor,” Ronnie explains, “I told you already my name is Ronnie Raymond - - and the two of us together are the guy called - - Firestorm, the Nuclear Man!</p><p>“Firestorm! That name, why does it haunt me?” Stein asks. “Like I told you, Professor Stein, I’m just your average jock high school student. To impress a girl named Doreen Day, I did something pretty dumb,” Ronnie answers, continuing, “I joined a bunch of phony protestors who were planning to bomb the Hudson Nuclear Plant, the experimental plant you designed and built.”</p><p>Ronnie sets a kettle on the stove and turns on the burner. “I think we could both use some coffee,” he says, continuing, “I didn’t know what they were going to do at the Plant until we got there that night, and broke in. They figured to use me as a patsy to take the blame for the bombing - - and when I made noises about calling the cops, they konked me. I guess that’s when you arrived, just in time for your own konking.”</p><p>Stein nods, recalling that fateful evening. “I…I remember that night. Some hoodlums had invaded the Plant,” he replies, adding, “I saw them on the security monitors, tried to stop them. I was struck…”</p><p>Ronnie pours two cups of coffee. “And the rest’s a blank, right?” he asks, explaining, “I figure the reason you can never remember what happens to us when we’re Firestorm is because you were unconscious when we first changed.” He hands the Professor a cup. “’Changed’?” Stein asks. “Me, I must have a thick skull,” Ronnie answers, “I woke up for the big bang…and when I saw that dynamite go off right next to your new experimental reactor, I was sure that was all she wrote! The next second, we were hit by a wave of radiation…I felt it pick me up, carry me on its crest…and right then, it happened - - the craziest thing in the world…</p><p>Ronnie relives the cataclysmic maelstrom of transformation that occurred next. “I feel - - like I’m melting! No, not melting - - merging! Like stereo images coming into focus!” Ronnie cries out, “I’m changing - - but I’m still alive! My mind feels like its crawling with information! Things I never knew before - - couldn’t even guess before! Suddenly, I almost seem to know what’s happening to me! That wall - - blown apart by the explosion! Just looking at it, I can ‘read’ its atomic structure! I can see how it’s composed of various molecular combinations - - and if I can see that, I can change it!”</p><p>Ronnie focuses nuclear restructuring energy at the damaged wall. “All I have to do is ‘touch’ the atoms of the escaping gas with a nuclear blast - - and I can mend the wreckage by rearranging the wall’s atomic structure. Fan-tas-tic!”</p><p>Ronnie looks quickly around the room, scanning the atomic structure of nearby objects. “Everywhere I look, I can see so clearly now! Whoops! Talk about seeing things clearly - - where’re my pants? Well, if I can fix walls, I can sure sew up a new pair of Wranglers! And since I’ve got the powers of some kind of super-hero…I might as well have the duds to match!”</p><p>Ronnie describes to Professor Stein how he lowered his atomic density to phase through the Plant’s wall, and then took flight for the first time in pursuit of Earhart and his gang. “After that, everything else sort of fell into place, Professor. The name, Firestorm…and the heroics…” Ronnie explains, asking, “I mean, if you’ve got power like that, you should use them, right?”</p><p>Ronnie rinses out his coffee cup. “The first thing we did was capture those fake demonstrators,” he explains, “Then we had run-ins with your ex-lab assistant, a guy named Danton Black who was also there that night…and crazies like Killer Frost…the Hyena…I wonder whatever happened to the Hyena, anyway?”</p><p>Ronnie walks closer to Stein. “There was just one thing wrong, Professor,” he continues, pointing a finger at his counterpart, “You. You could never remember any of our adventures. You thought you were having blackout spells. You started drinking. Pretty soon, word got around and your reputation was ruined. That’s why I quit being Firestorm for all these months, till Killer Frost came back, and I met Superman again and he asked us to join the Justice League.”</p><p>Ronnie remembers his induction ceremony on the Justice League Satellite with Zatanna, the Flash, Batman, Superman, the Atom, Black Canary, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, and Aquaman. “How could I say no? I mean, those guys are all heroes!” Ronnie explains, “I know I should have told you about us long ago…but I was scared…I was afraid you’d want to stop it, if you ever found out. I’m…sorry, Professor. I wouldn’t blame you if you quit.”</p><p>Stein thinks for a few moments and then suddenly bursts into laughter! “Hahahaha! Quit? Oh, young man! How can I quit something that’s simply another drunken delusion!” he chortles, falling back in hilarity on his bed. “It’s too rich! Too absurd! Oh, my, my, my!” he laughs. “Huh?” Ronnie says as he looks on in confusion, asking, “You think this is some kind of a joke?” Stein continues giggling and snickering. “Not a joke, my boy. Just a very bad dream!” he answers. Ronnie grows irritated. “Oh yeah? You want proof, Professor…” he begins, turning to yell right in the Professor’s face, “…you’ll get proof!”</p><p>BTHOOM! Instantly, Firestorm appears in Professor Stein’s apartment. Ronnie phases through the wall and flies out into the evening sky. “Ronald! What is the meaning of this?” Stein questions quickly. “Your subconscious persona is a lot more together than your up-front conscious mind, Professor! I told you the whole story - - but you didn’t believe it! After all my agonizing, you laughed at me!” Ronnie explains. Stein replies, “Ronald, try to understand. You were talking to a man who has lost most of his self-respect.”</p><p>Ronnie speeds down straight into the path of an oncoming elevated train. The driver sees him and hits the brakes! SQQUUEAL! The train’s wheels screech along the track as the train slows rapidly. At the last second before impact, Ronnie makes a tight 90-degree turn and flies off at breakneck speed. “That’s it,” thinks the stunned train driver, “Tomorrow, I go back to my old job running the Toy Town Limited at Macy’s!”</p><p>Ronnie flies down toward an industrial area near the train tracks. “How else could he react but with skepticism?” Stein asks, adding, “You must admit, our story is somewhat - - incredible!” Ronnie brings them to a landing on a factory rooftop. “You’re right, Professor. As always,” he answers. “The thing is, I promised him proof,” Ronnie thinks, “But how can you prove a thing like this? When he wakes up, he’ll think he’s just had another blackout. He’ll never believe the truth.”</p><p>Stein thinks for a moment, then suggests, “Perhaps if you gave him a picture…” Ronnie wonders, “Huh? What’re you - - oh! I get it! A series of photos, before, after, and during a change! Perfect!” Ronnie aims a restructuring beam at a nearby TV antenna, transforming it into a camera mounted on a tripod. “Hope this works, Professor! I never did take a good picture…” Ronnie tells him.</p><p>Not long after… “I don’t know what to say…” Stein says in shock. He looks over three incredible pictures showing the moments of fission when Firestorm transforms back into Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond. “…These pictures…Unbelievable! But…But I must believe them. It explains so much. And it means…I wasn’t having a nervous breakdown after all…” Ronnie smiles at him. “That isn’t all it means, Professor,” he replies, “It looks like we’ve both found a friend.”</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Hawkman in ""<strong>She's No Angel</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,20701,"{'icon_url':

Webb throws a lamp at Allen, causing him to miss his shot. The gunshot alerts young Troy Nathan to Webb's predicament. Outside Webb's door, Troy declares that he's the police, then accidentally stumbles into Webb's apartment. Allen flees out the window. Troy ushers Webb over to his apartment, where he tells his father, Mack Nathan, that Allen just tried to murder Webb. Professional killer, and master of disguise, Saber-Tooth, is booked by the police. Captain Darryl Frye praises the Flash for bringing Saber-Tooth in.</p><p>Nathan calls Allen, at the police laboratory, to inform him of the murder attempt on Webb's life. A pair of hired killers blast King Faraday's helicopter out of the sky. Literally running on the dust particles within a searchlight beam, the Flash races up to the helicopter, and pulls Faraday, and the pilot, out. On the ground, the Flash creates a super-speed generated updraft to cushion the helicopter's impact with the street, while simultaneously extinguishing the flames. The Flash and Faraday take out the two would-be killers.</p><p>The Flash takes Faraday to police headquarters, leaving him outside the police laboratory. A few moments later, the Flash, as Allen, steps out of the lab, and introduces himself to Faraday. A mysterious figure fires a crossbow bolt into Saber-Tooth's jail cell. Faraday, speaking with Allen and Nathan, reveals that the man who tried to kill Webb was really syndicate boss, Ross Malverk. Astonishingly, Malverk is a dead ringer for Allen. A police protection detail is stationed within, and outside of Webb's apartment. Allen, too, checks in on Webb, invisibly, as the Flash.</p><p>A pair of hired killers fire a bazooka shell into Saber-Tooth's jail cell. The Flash arrives, in the nick of time, to kick the shell away. The Flash rounds up the would-be assassins, and turns them over to police custody. At police headquarters, the Flash learns that Saber-Tooth, using the gear that was attached to the crossbow bolt, has escaped police custody. The Flash, as Allen, hears the news that Malverk has turned himself in. Having attempted to assassinate Saber-Tooth, Malverk is now in the killer's crosshairs. The Flash, as Allen, wanders the seedier areas of Central City, hoping his identical appearance to Malverk, will flush Saber-Tooth out.</p><p>Saber-Tooth, wearing an outlandish costume to conceal his identity, confronts Allen. Saber-Tooth hurls an incendiary grenade at Allen. When the smoke clears, all that is left is Allen's empty clothes. Allen, as the Flash, confronts Saber-Tooth. Saber-Tooth takes flight to avoid the Flash's lunge. The exhaust from Saber-Tooth's jet pack blinds the Flash. The Flash zig-zags back and forth across the street, until he comes in contact with Saber-Tooth. The Flash beats Saber-Tooth into unconsciousness. The case closed, the Flash, as Allen, asks Webb out to dinner. Webb suggests, instead, that they dine at her place.</p><h3><ins>The Hyena Laughs Last!</ins></h3><p>In the garment district, Firestorm separates into his component parts, Professor Martin Stein and Ronald Raymond. Stein considers getting a drink before a job interview. Raymond reads Stein the riot act. At school, Raymond is needled by Cliff Carmichael, for missing basketball practice, Carmichael is rebuffed by one of Raymond's teammates. Raymond accompanies Doreen Day to the airport, to pick up her sister, Summer.</p><p>Stein aces the interview, landing a position at Concordance Research, Inc. Stein considers getting a drink to celebrate, then remembers Raymond's heated words to him. Stein sees a shadowy figure leaping across the rooftops. Stein recognizes the figure, on a subconscious level, and triggers the transformation into Firestorm. Stein's subconscious leads Firestorm to the rooftops, where Firestorm is attacked by the Hyena.</p><p><ins><strong>Firestorm826's Panel-by-Panel Story Summary (Spoiler Alert)</strong></ins></p><p>Two men fused by a bizarre nuclear explosion: One is Nobel Prize-winning physicist Professor Martin Stein; the other is teenager Ronnie Raymond, and together they form - - Firestorm, the Nuclear Man!</p><p>They call it Tailor Row, otherwise known as the Garment District, and once, it was the very heart of the Borough called Manhattan. But that was years ago; cheap labor in the South and overseas has done its work, and the heartbeat has slowed, if not stopped. Now, it is primarily a commercial area, crowded with inexpensive shops and overstocked department stores…and behind one such store this afternoon, something strange is about to occur…</p><p>Witness Firestorm, the self-styled Nuclear Man, manipulator of atomic structures and newest member of the Justice League. Witness the most bizarre transformation in the history of heroes, as one super-being fissions into two separate men: Ronnie Raymond, typical teenager and student at Bradley High in Upper Manhattan…and Professor Martin Stein, discredited physicist and designer of the Hudson Nuclear Facility.</p><p>Firestorm comes down to land at a warehouse loading dock next to a Ridings Shipping and Storage semi trailer. Hidden among the trailers and shipping crates, Ronnie begins the transformation to reverse the Firestorm fusion. Seconds later, the two men stumble away from Firestorm into their separate personas.</p><p>“Okay, Professor, you’ve got plenty of time to make this appointment,” Ronnie tells Stein. “I feel ridiculous. Like a youngster straight out of school,” Stein replies. Ronnie reaches over and adjusts Stein’s tie. “Just relax and keep loose. You’ll do fine,” he reassures Stein. Nearby, a snoozing trucker leaning against a large wooden crate yawns and awakens. “It’s been years since I went on a job interview,” Stein replies, adding, “Perhaps a small drink first…”</p><p>Ronnie interjects quickly, “No! That’s out! Remember, we agreed. I’m helping you get back on your feet, but only if you give up the booze. Maybe your breakdown was partly Firestorm’s fault, because you didn’t understand what was happening when we fused into the Nuclear Man - - but now you know the truth, and you’ve got to pull yourself together. No more drinking, Professor. You promised.”</p><p>Ronnie and Professor Stein walk out of the loading area. Behind them, the truck driver gets to his feet and pulls on his shirt. “Good place for a nap,” he yawns as he heads for the cab of his truck, “Nobody ever bothers ya. And nuthin’ ever happens to wake ya up!”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, as the Uptown bus shlumps to a stop outside Bradley High… “After flying around town as Firestorm, taking a bus is a real letdown!” Ronnie thinks, “I hope the Professor does okay on his job interview…’cause he really needs a boost to his ego.” Ronnie steps off the bus walking towards class. “Imagine losing your reputation as a scientist without ever knowing why it was happening!” he thinks.</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t Bradley High’s answer to Magic Johnson!” calls out Cliff Carmichael when he sees Ronnie approaching. Cliff, Jackson, and Doreen stand together talking. “I hear you’ve been missing basketball practice, Raymond,” Cliff taunts him. “That’s my business, Carmichael,” Ronnie replies, asking, “Go ride someone else, okay?” Cliff walks up and pokes him in the chest. “What’s wrong, Raymond? Think you’re too good for the team?” he snarls, asking, “Or are you just afraid of losing?”</p><p>Jackson stands nearby spinning a basketball on his fingertip. “Say now, Cliff, that’s my teammate you’re dumpin’ on,” he warns Cliff. He reaches out and touches Cliff’s shoulder. “J-Ja-Jackson,” Cliff stammers, “I thought…I mean, missing practice…I thought…” Jackson glares at him. “I know what you thought, man, you thought wrong. Go find a rock and crawl under it. Catch what I’m sayin’?” he answers.</p><p>Cliff quickly walks off. “That boy’s got more mouth than he knows what to do with,” Jackson tells Ronnie and Doreen. “But you know, underneath that wise-off exterior - - there’s a real low-life creep. What can I say? The truth is the truth,” Doreen says. She grabs Ronnie’s and Jackson’s arms and the three head off laughing.</p><p>A little later, and some miles southeast, at Kennedy Airport… “Thanks for coming along to pick up my sister, Ronnie,” Doreen tells him. They ride along in a convertible with the top down on a pleasant sunny day. Jets take to the sky behind them as they drive up to the terminal. “The way you sounded back at school when you asked me, I couldn’t say no,” Ronnie answers, asking, “What’s the trouble? Where’s Summer been all these months, anyway?”</p><p>Doreen guides the car to a stop. “Maybe I should talk about it, Ronnie. You’re a friend…” she replies. “You know I’m a friend, Doreen,” Ronnie answers, asking, “So what’s worrying you about Summer? She’s okay, isn’t she? I heard she’d been sick, but I thought…” Doreen sees Summer walking towards them from the terminal. “Shhssh!” she interjects, “Here she comes!”</p><p>Ronnie and Doreen get out of her car and walk over to greet Summer. “Little sister, good to see you. And hey, here’s your pal, Ronnie,” Summer greets them. Ronnie reaches to take Summer’s suitcase. “Let me tell you, after drying my lungs out in Arizona, it’s great to breathe New York smog again,” Summer tells them. She pulls back on her suitcase, surprising Ronnie. “I’ll keep the bag, Ron. Us big girls can carry our own luggage, right?” she says. “Uh…sure, right, Miss Day,” Ronnie replies hesitantly. “Call me Summer. My folks had a real gift for names,” she answers. Summer loads her suitcase in the trunk and the three drive off. “Boy, she’s just like I remembered her - - as brittle as ever,” Ronnie thinks, “Something tells me that having Summer Day around is going to be as much fun as watching TV blindfolded!”</p><p>Afternoon light throws long shadows in Midtown, an hour later, as a dazed Professor Martin Stein leaves the Concordance Building on Sixth Avenue. “Unbelievable,” he thinks, shaking his fists happily. “I got the job! I start work tomorrow at Concordance Research, Incorporated!” He walks down the street and spots a neighborhood bar. “This requires a drink in celebration!” he thinks. He stops abruptly and leans against a mailbox. “No! Dear Heaven, what was I thinking of? I promised Ronald!” he thinks anxiously, “I came so close to destroying myself just now…It’s frightening! We tread such a narrow path between survival and self-destruction, I can never let myself misstep, even once! This is a chance to recoup what I’ve lost. I don’t dare to - - eh?”</p><p>A figure leaps from rooftop to rooftop overhead. “Someone running across the roof of that building across the street..,” Stein thinks as he watches the odd person, “There’s something familiar about that inhuman shape - - why can’t I remember where I’ve seen that person before?” he thinks.</p><p>He grips his head with his hands and starts walking. “I must have encountered him as Firestorm! But I never remember what happens as the Nuclear Man! Only Ronald knows - - Ronald! Oh my Heaven!” Dsitracted by his thoughts, Professor Stein has inadvertently walked out into traffic. Cars barrel right at him. BLAAAHH! A car horn honks at him. “RONALD!” Stein thinks in panic.</p><p>It isn’t telepathy, not exactly, but there is a link between scientist and student that defies description…It’s a byproduct of the nuclear blast that joined them, months ago…and thus, when one of them needs the other, and calls for help, even subconsciously, it activates the remarkable transformation - - the instantaneous fusion - - that creates Firestorm, the Nuclear Man!</p><p>FTOOM! Firestorm appears in the midst of the busy street. BEEP BEEP! A taxi’s horn bleats as it careens towards the Nuclear Man. Ronnie looks at it and quickly lowers his atomic density. The taxi harmlessly passes right through him! “Hey! That tickles!” Ronnie calls out, turning to watch the cab drive off. “It would have done far more than tickle me, Ronald, without Firestorm’s ability to pass through molecular structures!” Stein tells him, adding, “But we have a more vital concern than a mere near-miss traffic accident!”</p><p>Drivers and bystanders look on in shock at the sudden appearance of Firestorm. “Like what, Professor? Say…did you get the job?” Ronnie asks. “Irrelevant, Ronald, but yes, I did, thanks to the confidence you inspired in me,” Stein answers, explaining, “But what matters is what I just saw on a nearby roof…A figure that my conscious mind failed to recognize, but that was all too familiar to this, my subconscious persona!”</p><p>Ronnie leaps into the air. “So don’t keep me in suspense, Professor,” he answers, asking, “Who’d you see?

Inside the Hall Of Mirrors, Allen sees a reflection of Samuel Scudder, the notorious Mirror Master. In their last encounter, Allen, as the Flash, had been in pursuit of the Mirror Master, when a pool of liquid mirror, mistaken for a puddle of water, detonated under his feet. Not only was the Flash rendered unconscious, but a post-hypnotic suggestion was planted in his mind, allowing him, and only him, to see Scudder's reflection in the Hall of Mirrors.</p><p>Scudder telepathically teases his next scheme. Allen spends the rest of the afternoon brooding over Scudder's plans. Feeling neglected, Webb storms off. Allen returns to the Hall of Mirrors, that night, as the Flash. The Mirror Master is waiting for him, his reflection appearing in all of the mirrors. Suddenly, the Flash's body distorts into a fun house mirror version of himself. The Mirror Master leaps into one of the mirrors. When the Flash tries to pursue, the mirror shatters on impact, distorting the Flash's body anew. The Flash shatters all the mirrors. With the mirrors broken, the Flash reverts to normal.</p><p>The Mirror Master, though, has escaped. Racing home, the Flash finds his movements awkward and uncoordinated. Doffing his uniform, the Flash elects to walk home. The next morning, Webb arrives at Allen's apartment, to apologize for her behavior at the carnival. Allen notices the lid coming off the coffee urn, as Webb pours him a cup. Allen attempts to right the lid, at super-human speed, but instead jostles the urn, spilling coffee all over Webb. Once again, Webb storms off. Allen, as the Flash, heads out to get a batter idea of his condition.</p><p>As he runs, he finds himself even more uncoordinated than he was the night before, to the point of losing his balance, as he tumbles down the street. Spying his reflection, in a puddle of water, the Flash suddenly understands what has happened to him. A television news broadcast informs the Flash that the Mirror Master has stolen an enormous refracting mirror, from Mount Malomar Observatory. The Flash returns to the Hall Of Mirrors, the mirrors only having just recently been replaced. The Mirror Master has reversed the Flash's very being, thus incapacitating his ability to move at super-human speed.</p><p>The Flash only caught on when he saw the insignia of his uniform reflecting back normal, in the puddle of water, instead of reversed, as it should. Alternating his vibratory frequency, the Flash rushes into the mirrors, trying to find the right frequency to allow him to pass into the mirror dimension. After shattering several mirrors, again, the Flash finally passes into one. Upon racing back out of the mirror, the Flash is back to normal. To fool the Mirror Master into believing the Flash is still incapacitated, the Flash reverses the emblem on his uniform.</p><p>The Flash tracks the Mirror Master down, his presence automatically triggering a death ray the Mirror Master has aimed at Central City. With no time for games, the Flash beats the Mirror Master into unconsciousness, then outraces the laser beam to Central City. With buckets of silver nitrate, the Flash coats the windows of a skyscraper, turning them into mirrors. The laser is reflected, harmlessly, into the sky. The Flash, as Allen, manages to convince Webb to go out with him again. For his wanton destruction of the Hall of Mirrors, on two separate occasions, the carnival bans the Flash from their premises.</p><h3><ins>The Hostages Of Precinct 13!</ins></h3><p>Firestorm is attacked by the Hyena. By the team Firestorm recovers from being ambushed, the Hyena has moved on, attacking a local police precinct house. Firestorm moves in to engage, but the Hyena takes the police captain hostage. The Hyena demands media coverage, or else he will slaughter the police captain. The Hyena holds a press conference, wherein he criticizes New York's finest. When a police bulletin comes in, regarding a robbery, the Hyena bolts from the precinct house. Firestorm pursues. While Firestorm gets the shop keeper to safety, the Hyena tears into the thieves. By the time Firestorm returns to the scene of the carnage, the Hyena has escaped.</p><p><ins><strong>Firestorm826's Panel-by-Panel Story Summary (Spoiler Alert)</strong></ins></p><p>Two men fused by a bizarre nuclear explosion: One is Nobel Prize-winning physicist Professor Martin Stein; the other is teenager Ronnie Raymond, and together, they form…Firestorm, the Nuclear Man!</p><p>It’s not strength that makes the Hyena deadly, although the Hyena is strong; it’s not the silver slashing claws, though these too are menacing…The Hyena is a killer - - mad, vicious, ferocious, and sly - - and what the Hyena attacks, dies!</p><p>The Hyena lunged from a rooftop, attacking Firestorm as he flew past. The Hyena rakes Firestorm with his claws as the two fall from the sky. “This guy’s a maniac!” Ronnie thinks as he struggles. “I answer a call for help from Professor Stein, and he tells me about seeing ‘someone’ on a roof…I go to take a look, and whammo! This escapee from a gorilla movie is all over me, like a hot cheerleader!</p><p>The Hyena scratches at Firestorm’s chest, shredding and tattering his costume. “Nuts to that! I’m taking action!” Ronnie thinks. FTOOM! He fires a nuclear burst that smashes into the Hyena’s chest! The Hyena is blown back.</p><p>“The last time I saw the Hyena was months ago, back when he teamed up with Multiplex! He almost tore me to pieces! Well I won’t give him the chance to do that again!” Ronnie thinks as watches the Hyena. “This time I’m gonna take the initiative and - - UNNGH!” Ronnie grunts from the Hyena’s kick. The frenzied beast had fallen onto a flagpole, pivoted around it and launched himself back like a slingshot into Firestorm! Ronnie is knocked back headfirst through the air!</p><p>“Ronald, if I may say so, you approached this situation quite inappropriately,” Professor Stein suggests.</p><p>“Save it, Professor. In case you hadn’t noticed…I’m about to break my neck..!” Ronnie replies as he falls. People on the sidewalk below start to scatter at the sight of the plummeting Nuclear Man. “Too dazed to fly…Can barely think..! But I’ve gotta try to keep from going splat all over West 44<sup>th</sup> Street…even if I’m not half-sure what I’m doing…Only chance…hope it works…”</p><p>FTOOM! Ronnie beams a transforming burst into a car just below him. Instantly, it turns into a soft, car-shaped cushion! SPROIINNG! Ronnie lands safely on top of it. “Really, Ronald - - using your atomic restructuring powers to change an automobile into foam rubber?” Stein asks.</p><p>“I didn’t hear you suggest something better, Professor,” Ronnie replies as he hops onto the sidewalk. “Besides, it did the job…and no one got hurt…least of all, me!”</p><p>From the adjacent Willie’s Pub, an inebriated man stumbles out of the doorway. He fumbles for his keys as he walks up to the foam car. “Boy, ish Marge gonna cream me tonight. Better think of a good excuse,” he thinks. He puts his key in the car’s door lock, only to be dumbfounded by the soft foam material. “I…wonder…Hic!..when the train leavesh for Timbuktu?” he thinks as he wobbles away.</p><p>Ronnie looks down at his ripped and torn uniform. “Lucky those claws only slashed my costume. If the Hyena is running true to style, the claws were probably poisoned!” He waves a hand and mends the holes and tears in the fabric. “Who is that guy, anyway? Why’d he disappear all those months ago?” he thinks as he flies back up the street. “And why did he come back? What does he want this time - - huh?”</p><p>CRASH! “EEEYAAAH!” Just below, a police officer smashes through the lobby window of Precinct 13, landing hard on the sidewalk below. “Oh my gosh, I don’t believe it!” Ronnie blurts as he looks inside the lobby. “The Hyena is attacking that precinct house! That’s what he was heading for! He’s crazy, absolutely out of his mind!”</p><p>“Remember, Ronald, the Hyena has always displayed a pathological hatred for the police. Oddly, he seemed to hate criminals almost as intensely,” Stein cautions.</p><p>“That didn’t stop him from teaming up with Multiplex to kill me, Prof,” Ronnie replies.</p><p>“I think he was misled, Ronald, moreover, he identifies you with the police, and thus, hates you as much as he hates them!” Stein explains.</p><p>Ronnie lowers his atomic density and starts to phase through the front door of the precinct house. “Which still doesn’t explain what he’s doing in a police station, Pro…” Ronnie emerges on the other side, exclaiming, “Holy Hannah!”</p><p>Just ahead, the Hyena stands on the precinct lobby desk. He holds the station’s Captain by the neck; the officer’s feet dangle just above the floor. “One more step, Firestorm, heh-heh-heh! And the Police Captain here is so much dead meat, hii-hii-hii!”</p><p>“Please…do what he says!” gasps the terrified Captain.</p><p>“Take it easy, fella, just relax. What do you want?” Ronnie asks as he cautiously approaches the Hyena.</p><p>“I’m so glad you asked, heh-heh. I want a TV news crew,” the Hyena answers. “Get one or the fat boy in blue dies, hi-hi-hi.”</p><p>At that moment, only two blocks away… “Okay, you know what to do,” a masked thug tells his partners. They pull their van to a stop outside the Goldberg’s Jewelry shop. “Right. We grab the old guy who owns the place,” another thug answers. “We get him to open his safe,” the driver adds. The leader nods, adding, “And if he gives us any grief - - we waste ‘im.”</p><p>The door swings open and the three armed masked men step into the small shop. “M-May I help you gentlemen?” asks the elderly owner warily.</p><p>“…Come on, come on, what took you so long?” Ronnie asks. He stands outside the precinct house where a crew from WXYZ-TV is unloading equipment from their van.</p><p>“Ever hear of rush hour, Carrot-Top? What’s the story here anyway?” the reporter asks. She plugs her remote microphone into her cameraman’s shoulder-held TV camera. They follow Firestorm into the station as she adds, “All the dispatcher said was to rush right over to Precinct 13 and - - uh-oh.”</p><p>“A lady of the press, heh-heh! How kind of you to come, hi-hi-hi,” the Hyena giggles. “I have a statement to make, hi-hi, concerning the police of this fair city…”</p><p>Ronnie leans against the door looking into the lobby. Several unconscious officers lay strewn about the floor amidst overturned desks and chairs. “Calm down, Ronald. There’s nothing you can do. You can’t even direct a nuclear blast at the Hyena, since our restructuring powers cannot affect organic objects - - especially people,” Stein advises.</p><p>“I know…and it’s eating me up, Professor,” Ronnie replies.</p><p>“Patience, Ronald. If strength will not serve us, wits will,” Stein suggests.</p><p>“I wish I shared your optimism as well as half your mind, Professor,” Ronnie answers. “Right now, things look about as bad as they can get.”</p><p>“Will you explain for our cameras just why you took this Precinct hostage, Mr. - - er - - Hyena?” asks the WXYZ-TV reporter.</p><p>“To expose corruption, my dear, heh-heh-heh! This is supposed to be New York’s finest! The best! But look! Disgustingly overweight…smug…a poltroon, he-he-hee!” the Hyena explains, tapping at the Captain’s belly. “They reject those who would serve the people of this city, hi-hi, and instead - - instead…heh-heh?”</p><p>Breeeeee! The Hyena’s voice trails as an alarm goes off on the Captain’s desk. Inside Goldberg’s Jewelry shop, the owner has reached below the display case to activate the silent robbery alarm.</p><p>“That’s a burglar alarm! Some scum is robbing a jewelry store up the street, heh-heh!” the Hyena cries out. “Get out of my way, you fat fool!” He drops the Captain and leaps away!</p><p>The surprised reporter ducks out of the way, blurting, “Wait! What about your speech? I thought…”</p><p>“Speeches don’t matter! Nothing matters…but to get those scum!” the Hyena calls back as he sprints out the front door, passing right by Firestorm.</p><p>“Now, Ronald, strike now!” Professor Stein urges as the Hyena flashes past.</p><p>Ronnie leaps to the air, closely pursuing the Hyena. “No, Professor, not yet…I’ve got a hunch about this! If the Hyena hates crooks as much as he says he does…this could be verrrry interesting!”</p><p>The three gunmen drag the Mr. Goldberg out of the jewelry shop to the sidewalk. One tightly holds the owner from behind. The other two carry large bags of loot and scan up and down the sidewalk with guns at ready. “Hurry up, old man. You’re coming with us for protection!” a thug barks as he pushes the old man toward the getaway van. “Yeah, nobody is gonna stop us while we’ve got you as a hostage!” another thug adds.</p><p>“Wanna bet? HEE-HI-HEEE! HII-HII-HIII-HA-HA-HA!” the Hyena yells as he leaps onto the top of the getaway van.</p><p>Then, the Hyena is among them, slashing, like the scavenger of the African veldt whose name the Hyena bears… “HII-HI-HA-HA-HA!” the Hyena cackles as it rips into the panicked gunmen.</p><p>“Gotta get this old man out of danger!” Ronnie thinks.

By racing around a fountain, the Flash generates a water spout, that carries the Pied Piper away from the crowd. Upon interrogation, the Pied Piper states that he was merely playing to keep the elephants away. As if on cue, a horde of rampaging elephants come tearing down the street. Stamping his feet, at super-human speed, the Flash generates enough heat friction to melt the asphalt into molten tar, impeding the elephants' charge. The Pied Piper blackmails the city into paying him $250,000.00 to lead the elephants away.</p><p>The Flash, as police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, next encounters the Pied Piper, outside of a theater. With the crowd riveted on the Pied Piper's performance, Allen switches into his Flash costume. The Flash gathers a collection of wind instruments, and begins playing them, at super-human speed, in unison. Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash steals the Pied Piper's pipe, and makes a subtle adjustment to it, before returning it to his hand. The Pied Piper screams at the Flash to stop playing. As soon as the Flash complies, a horde of enraged ostriches descend on the theater district.</p><p>The Pied Piper plays the ostriches away, but this time, instead of controlling them, the angry birds surround him. The Flash forces the Pied Piper to confess his crimes before he moves to rescue him. The Flash catches the ostriches in his slipstream, and carries them out of the city, to a series of waiting cages. The Pied Piper gives back the money he took from the city, and then is turned over to the proper authorities.</p><h3><ins>The Deadliest Man Alive!</ins></h3><p>As the Flash races past Metropolis, he carelessly generates a sonic boom. The impact of the sonic boom reaches all the way to ""Superman's Island"", a special prison designed to hold Superman's greatest foes. Though faded before impact, the force of the sonic boom is still great enough to compromise the integrity of one of the prison cells. Realizing the danger of what he's done, the Flash makes a sweep of Superman's Island. The Flash is quick to discover an unconscious prison guard. Suddenly the Flash is hit with a bolt of radiation, courtesy of the Atomic Skull.</p><p>With the Flash incapacitated, the Atomic Skull takes his leave of the prison. Realizing that the lethal radiation will kill him within the hour, the Flash races to New York City, to seek the aid of Firestorm, the Nuclear Man. Firestorm rescues an attempted suicide. Firestorm's attention is drawn to the street, where he sees the Flash generating a glowing message of distress. Quickly ascertaining the situation, Firestorm absorbs the radiation from the Flash's body. The amount of excess radiation absorbed by Firestorm knocks him out of the sky. When he recovers, he seems intoxicated, as if by alcohol.</p><p>The Flash carries Firestorm to Colorado, where they find the Atomic Skull mining for uranium. The Flash undoes all of the Atomic Skull's work, before announcing his presence. After dodging another radiation burst, the Flash goads Firestorm into attacking him. The Flash races towards the Atomic Skull. At the last second, the Flash dodges Firestorm's nuclear blast, which instead fells the Atomic Skull. Having discharged the excess radiation from his body, Firestorm ""sobers up"", with no recollection of how he got to Colorado. Inexplicably, Firestorm feels a sense of umbrage towards the Flash, but the Scarlet Speedster is reluctant to explain why.</p><p><ins><strong>Firestorm826's Panel-by-Panel Story Summary (Spoiler Alert)</strong></ins></p><p>The Metropolis Seismological Survey Station, 6:42 p.m… “Holy Hannah! Look at the video display terminal!” a technician cries out in shock.</p><p>“It’s registering a Richter 8 temblor southeast of Metropolis” a scientist exclaims as he watches the incredible readout trace across the screen. “Wait! That’s no temblor! Look at the radar readout below the graph - - there’s something moving out there, at ground level! Something traveling at Mach 1!”</p><p>“Not something, Fred - - someone! That’s got to be the Flash!” the technician replies.</p><p>It’s the sort of incident that’s occurred a thousand times in the career of the fastest man alive, but this time, it will have dire consequences…</p><p>At Mach 1, any moving object crosses what is popularly known as the Sound Barrier. BOOM! Result: A sonic boom - - surely nothing unusual in the experience of the Scarlet Speedster. But this time, this sonic boom is going to do more than rattle a few windows and set a few dogs howling…Let’s follow it skyward, through layers of innocent cloud, as it expands like a ripple in pond water, filling a square mile before it begins to fade…</p><p>Unfortunately, its fading begins too late, for its already reached the 20,000 foot level, where a bizarre prison floats on an anti-gravity plate…A prison containing the most powerful and malicious villains in the country…among them a man named Dr. Albert Michaels - - but lately better known as the Atomic Skull!</p><p>Flash speeds along, running on the surface of the water near Metropolis. “I’ve been careless. Thinking about what’s been happening lately - - I didn’t realize what I was doing!” he worries. “It’s a maximum security lock-up where Superman keeps his most dangerous enemies after their convictions. I ‘boomed’ when I passed beneath it…and I’d better find out if I accidentally did any damage! Since I can’t fly, I’ll need to hitch a ride to 20,000 feet.”</p><p>Flash runs across an airport runway, leaping onto the wing of a jet on its takeoff roll. “Luckily, this commercial airliner seems to be going my way!” he thinks. VVVROOOM! The jet lifts off, quickly gaining altitude.</p><p>Seconds later, 20,000 feet above Metropolis… “There it is! No sign of any damage here. Still I’d better make absolutely certain..!” Flash thinks. He leaps off the wing of the jet towards a billowing cloud just below. “There’s just enough - - water vapor - - in these clouds - - to support my weight - - at super-speed - - but only for - - half a second!” he thinks as he stair-steps down to the floating prison.</p><p>“Now I’ll vibrate through the prison wall, and see if - - eh?” he thinks. Flash steps inside the control room of the prison. “That prison guard, sprawled unconscious - -?” he thinks, rushing to the man’s side.</p><p>“I see we have a visitor! Too bad you have come too late for the guided tour, Flash,” a voice calls out.</p><p>“YAAAHHHH!” Flash cries out as the Atomic Skull blasts him with energy.</p><p>“Still, let me introduce myself,” explains the Atomic Skull. “My name is Dr. Albert Michaels. I used to be the head of S.T.A.R. - - but more recently I’ve been known as the Atomic Skull!”</p><p>Flash stumbles back to his feet, clutching at his forehead. “W-What…hit me..?” he groans.</p><p>“Oh, you might call that a brain-blast, Flash,” answers Atomic Skull. “You see, I suffer from a rare neural disorder that causes a short-circuiting in my brain…A radium device was implanted in my skull in an attempt to control these neural seizures - - but instead, the radiation mutated them. Now my brain produces these strange energy blasts at random.”</p><p>Atomic Skull grabs Flash by the chest of his uniform, holding him at arms’ length. “It’s a peculiar power, I admit, but it’s my own,” Atomic Skull continues. “In my cell, I was rendered harmless by a device that counteracted my seizures before they could begin. A few minutes ago, something short-circuited the equipment, freeing me. I intend to make the most of my good fortune, by increasing the strength of my brain-blasts till they are sufficient to even destroy Superman!”</p><p>He flings Flash down to the floor and walks toward an airlock door. “For that, I’ll need more radium in its natural form,” Atomic Skull says. “But you needn’t concern yourself about that, Flash. You received quite a healthy dose of brain-blast radiation just now…I doubt you’ll live another hour.”</p><p>HSSSSSS! The airlock slides shut, and the Scarlet Speedster slumps forward…but only for a moment; reserves of strength are tapped…and an indomitable will is summoned…</p><p>“Need help!” Flash groans as he gets to his feet. An aura of residual energy from Atomic Skull’s brain-blast surrounds his body. “Vibrating…internally…to slow the effects of Skull’s brain-blast!” Flash thinks. “But somehow…have to get rid of this radiation…and there’s one hero who can help me…one who thrives on radiation…Firestorm, the Nuclear Man!”</p><p>New York, New York: They say it’s a hell of a town, and for some of its citizens, that old song lyric is the literal truth…</p><p>Case in point: Casper Jones, formerly a dress-cutter in the Garment District, currently unemployed…He’s a man who’s lost touch with his life, a man without a reason for living, and with a real determination to die…</p><p>“I’m gonna jump! Maybe somebody’ll care about me then, you think?” Jones yells down. He clings to the spire of the Empire State Building as police officers gather below him. “Sure, then I’ll be news! Then I’ll matter, after I’m dead!” he cries out. “But who cares, a man works his whole life at one job, and suddenly, nobody needs him anymore! Suddenly he’s a nothing! Well, I’m something, and I’m gonna jump!”</p><p>Firestorm sees Jones and flies over. “Hey, I know life is tough, but this isn’t the way out. Let’s talk about it, okay?” Ronnie asks as he hovers next to him.</p><p>“Huunnnhhh?” Jones blurts out in shock. Suddenly, he loses his grip and falls! “YAAAAAAHH!” he shrieks in panic.</p><p>“Now you’ve done it, Ronald! You startled the man so much he lost his grip!” Professor Stein exclaims.</p><p>“You ask me, Professor Stein, this guy lost his grip long ago!” Ronnie yells as he dives after the plummeting Casper Jones.</p><p>“You’re the mature half of our composite Firestorm persona, you tell me how a sane guy can think about killing himself!” Ronnie asks.</p><p>“I doubt this gentleman every seriously planned to harm himself, Ronald. His was a desperate cry for attention!” Stein explains.</p><p>“Well, attention he’s got. Now I want to save his dumb neck!” Ronnie replies. “A handy nuclear blast will rearrange the atomic structure of his t-shirt into a trim little parachute and harness…”</p><p>FTOOT! A parachute canopy appears instantly, and Jones begins to float slowly to the rooftop. “And just to make sure the guy doesn’t hurt himself landing…” Ronnie adds. FTOOM! He transforms a section of the roof into a pool. SPLASH! Jones lands safely, spraying water all over.</p><p>“Someday, Ronald, you won’t be able to maneuver your way out of a problem quite so handily,” Stein cautions.</p><p>“Y’know something, Professor?” Ronnie asks. “You may be one-half of this super-hero bod we both share - - but there are times when you’re more than half a pain in the - - huh?”</p><p>Ronnie’s eyes are drawn to a streak of red zooming through the streets below. “Am I seeing what I think I’m seeing?” he asks. He looks as the streak forms the words “FIRESTORM HELP” between the streets, alleys, and buildings. “That’s the Flash super-speeding down there, moving so fast he’s leaving a message glowing in the air,” Ronnie observes. “Hey…Did I say glowing?”</p><p>Ronnie dives quickly, pursing Flash to the waterfront. Flash slows to a walk and staggers. “Since when does Flashie glow?” Ronnie asks confusedly.</p><p>“From the look of things, Ronald, it appears he’s been exposed to high-level radiation!” Stein observes. “Quickly, try to absorb that deadly radiation…”</p><p>“I’m way ahead of you, Professor! They don’t call me the Nuclear Man just ‘cause of my good looks!” Ronnie answers. He hovers just above Flash with his arms outstretched, drawing the radiation out of the Flash. Flash grits his teeth and clenches his fists tightly as the dangerous radiation leaves his body.</p><p>“Another second, and I’ll be done with - - ARRGGHH!” Ronnie cries out. SSHZZOM! Radiation overloads Firestorm and he falls out of the air!</p><p>“Head’s clearing…almost fell human again!” Flash thinks. He turns to see Firestorm falling. “But…Firestorm! Something’s happened to him! He’s falling, barely conscious…” Flash sprints below Firestorm. “…Have to break his fall before he can - - WHOOF!” KRASH! Firestorm falls onto Flash, driving them both into a stack of wooden shipping crates. The boxes shatter under the heavy impact.</p><p>“Good thing I angled us to land against those crates,” Flash thinks. “Firestorm seems dazed, disoriented! What have I done to him?”</p><p>“Hiya, Flashie, old kiddo,” Ronnie mumbles with a sloppy salute. He stumbles to his feet. Flash tries to help him stand but Ronnie pushes Flash away. “I’ll be fine in a second. Jus’ a little dizzy, thass all,” Ronnie rambles.</p><p>“Great Scott, he’s intoxicated! The excess radiation he drained from my body must have overloaded his nervous system - - like too much liquor!” Flash worries. “Who knows what sort of damage this could do to him? He has to get rid of that extra energy, and the best way to do that…is to send that radiation back where it came from!”</p><p>Flash grabs Firestorm and pulls him over his shoulder. He starts to sprint away from the docks. “Come on, youngster. We’re going to find the Atomic Skull!” Flash explains.</p><p>“Great. Terrific. What an ide-YURRRKK!” Ronnie blurts as Flash gains speed quickly.</p><p>There’s a song about the Colorado High, but the mountains of that state are known for far more than pop country music…Here, among these blue-tipped peaks, lies one of the largest deposits of natural uranium in the world, and it is this which has brought the Atomic Skull to Colorado today…</p><p>SKROOM! Blasts of energy, activated by the radium implant in his brain, have allowed the Atomic Skull to lay bare the bones of this mountain, revealing the secret marrow of uranium ore…Now, he prepares to feed on that exposed marrow…unaware that others are arriving with a different plan. Behind him a streak of red light approaches, quickly winding between the mountain passes.</p><p>RRUMBLE! Tremors shake and ripple through the area. “Wh-What? The entire mountain is trembling!” the Atomic Skull exclaims. “But there isn’t an earthquake fault within a hundred miles of…”</p><p>Suddenly, an avalanche forms and a river of dirt and rocks cascades down and over the uranium deposit. “No, no, no! All my work, all the effort - - wasted!” the Atomic Skull cries out. “Buried under a landslide! Now I’ll have to begin again!”</p><p>“And if you do it again, I’ll bury it again, Skull...just as I did this time, with super-speed vibration!” Flash yells to the Atomic Skull.</p><p>Ronnie staggers and looks around. “Hey, great bushes. Thish is what I call the wild outdoors,” he mumbles.</p><p>“I’ll - - KILL YOU!” the Atomic Skull yells in rage. He leaps into the air and focuses as brain-blast at Firestorm and Flash.</p><p>“Just as I thought! He’s so angry, he’s losing control!” Flash worries as he reaches for the wobbling Firestorm. “I figured we’d find him here, after what he said at the floating prison about wanting to increase his supply of natural radium,” he thinks.</p><p>FWOOM! A brain-blast speeds toward them. Flash grabs Firestorm and moves them both safely out of the way. The brain-blast smashes into the mountainside, exploding in a rain of debris. “He won’t catch me with one of his atomic blasts this time…I’m expecting them…and if I can just keep Firestorm from getting killed…” Flash thinks.</p><p>“Wow, lookit that bush blow up! What a trip!” Ronnie blurts out. Flash races toward a rocky outcrop, carrying Firestorm on his shoulder. “WHEEEE!” Ronnie yells happily.</p><p>“We might be able to overload the Skull, by hitting him with a radiation blast just as he fires one of his own! There’s only one possible problem…Firestorm!” Flash worries. “He’s so out of it, he can’t possibly manage the timing!”</p><p>Flash sets Firestorm down against the rocks as the Atomic Skull starts to descend toward them. “Hiya, Flashie, can we do that again?” Ronnie asks incoherently.</p><p>“You dumb cluck, what good are you? You’re useless!” Flash yells at him.</p><p>“Say, thass not a nice thing to say!” Ronnie babbles back.</p><p>“You don’t deserve to be a member of the JLA! You can’t even hit what you aim at!” Flash taunts.</p><p>Ronnie stands and puffs his chest out. “Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Well I can hit you, smart-mouth!” Ronnie replies.</p><p>“Let’s see you do it. Blast me with all you’ve got, unless you’re just talk!” Flash answers.</p><p>“Just talk, huh? I’ll show you, you big red cheese!” Ronnie replies as energy starts to form in his hands.</p><p>Flash speeds up the rocky outcrop, toward where the Atomic Skull is about to land. “Good! Now if I can just time this to the split second!” Flash thinks as he runs.</p><p>The Atomic Skull lands.

In Gorillas City, the Flash sits down with King Solovar, and his advisors, to discuss the situation. A trio of armed men storm the Gorilla City embassy. Taking the intelligent apes hostage, there men demand sophisticated weaponry from Gorilla City. When word reaches King Solovar, the Flash races back to the states. En route, the Flash takes time out to rescue a small cabin cruiser, caught in a violent squall, in the North Atlantic Ocean. Upon reaching the Gorilla City embassy, the Flash instantly disarms the terrorists. Their leader triggers an explosive, hidden in the Gorilla City embassy.</p><p>In literally one second flat, the Flash finds and disposes of the explosive, before it can detonate. A man named William Dawson is discovered in Grodd's prison cell. The ape sentries release Dawson, and inform King Solovar that, once again, the Super-Gorilla has escaped. In the arctic, near the Earth's North Magnetic Pole, King Solovar initiates Operation Worldwash. King Solovar has constructed a beacon that will erase all knowledge, from the minds of the human race, regarding Gorilla City, King Solovar, and his advanced society of intelligent apes. Only the Flash will be allowed to retain his knowledge of Gorilla City. Dawson wanders outside the Gorilla City limits, into the jungle.</p><p>By the time King Solovar orders Dawson detained, he has escaped. Dawson resumes his true identity, that of the Super-Gorilla, Grodd. Back in New York, the Flash rescues a pair of plummeting window washers. A crowd begins to form around the abandoned Gorilla City embassy. No one has any recollection regarding the purpose of the empty facility. In the Arctic, Grood takes out KIng Solovar's sentries. Grodd makes an adjustment to King Solovar's beacon, so that it will also erase all knowledge of Grodd, not just from the minds of men, but apes, as well. The sentries can no longer recall the face of their attacker. The Flash had suspected an act of sabotage was imminent, but no longer recalls the threat. With all knowledge of his existence erased, Grodd now has the advantage of surprise over his foes.</p><h3><ins>The Typhoon Is A Storm Of The Soul</ins></h3><p>Firestorm, the Nuclear Man, subdues a gang of female thieves. Afterwards, Firestorm separates into his two component parts, Professor Martin Stein and Ronald Raymond. Stein informs Raymond that he will be at sea, for two months, on a research vessel. During that time, Raymond will not be able to summon Firestorm, as it would be impossible to explain Stein's sudden absence. Crestfallen, Raymond reluctantly agrees. Captain Hammer bullies Stein into signing off on the readiness of the ""Manta"", an experimental bathysphere.</p><p>Drake, the bathysphere's pilot, voices concerns over a storm forming on the horizon. Hammer bullies Drake into taking the bathysphere down. Back in New York, Raymond, honoring his promise to Stein, is forced to ignore a priority alert from the <a href=""/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/"" data-ref-id=""4060-31815"">Justice League of America</a>. The storm overtakes Hammer's ship. Deciding that there's no time to bring the ""Manta"" back on board, Hammer opts to cut it loose. With Drake's life in jeopardy, Stein triggers the transformation into Firestorm.</p><p>Note: This issue contains already prepared material that was a result of the DC Implosion from the series <a href=""/firestorm-the-nuclear-man/4050-18409/"" data-ref-id=""4050-18409"">Firestorm</a>.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad ""<strong>Aquaman and the Space Capsule</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21006,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469049-%24%28kgrhqfhjewfjftljb%2Cjbsvom9zrig~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",294,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55839/', 'id': 55839, 'name': 'Gorilla City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gorilla-city/4020-55839/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}]",The Fiend The World Forgot!/The Typhoon Is A Storm of The Soul,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3271/', 'id': 3271, 'name': 'Bob Wiacek', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bob-wiacek/4040-3271/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6609/', 'id': 6609, 'name': 'Don Heck', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/don-heck/4040-6609/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40871/', 'id': 40871, 'name': 'Gerry Conway', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gerry-conway/4040-40871/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7922/', 'id': 7922, 'name': 'Jim Starlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jim-starlin/4040-7922/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41457/', 'id': 41457, 'name': 'Len Wein', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/len-wein/4040-41457/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-294-the-fiend-the-world-forgot-the-typho/4000-21006/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-58763/', 'id': 58763, 'name': 'Super Intelligent Gorillas', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/super-intelligent-gorillas/4060-58763/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Thus, a crowd of puzzled New Yorkers gaze upon the one time Gorilla City embassy, pondering the purpose of the facility. The only clue to it's former occupants, a trash bin full of banana peels. Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, escorts his date, Fiona Webb, to the Central City Zoo. Allen is the only human being who has been allowed to keep his memories of Gorilla City, and it's advanced ape society. With the culture of the Western world no longer an influence on his people, King Solovar can finally sleep.</p><p>In his dream, King Solovar wanders the Sahara Desert. Unexpectedly, he is attacked by the Flash. When the Flash pulls back his cowl, however, it is not the face King Solovar is accustomed to seeing. The Flash stamps the ground, at super-human speed, opening up a fissure beneath King Solovar. King Solovar uses his mental powers to break his fall, only to see the fissure collapse around him, burying him alive. King Solovar awakens, deeply troubled by the dream. While Allen sleeps, a sinister figure enters his bedroom, and tampers with his Flash Costume Ring. In Allen's dream, he is being pursued, in his guise as the Flash, by King Solovar.</p><p>Using his mental powers, King Solovar impedes the Flash from using his full super-speed. King Solovar herds the Flash towards the Grand Canyon, then over a cliffside. King Solovar suspends the Flash in a tractor beam, then obliterates the Scarlet Speedster, with the power of his mind. Allen awakens, deeply troubled by his dream. King Solovar and Allen, as the Flash, meet in the Arctic, each believing the other summoned them there. In truth, their meeting has been engineered by the evil Super-Gorilla, Grodd. Due to Grodd's psychic conditioning, during their dreams, the Flash and King Solovar, upon seeing one another, are driven into a murderous fury.</p><p>King Solovar throws up a psychic shield to brunt the Flash's charge, but the impact is so great that the Flash barrels right through it. King Solovar crushes the Flash in a death grip, while the Flash speeds up his molecules to generate tremendous friction heat, burning his opponent. Grodd maneuvers his craft in for a closer look, immediately getting caught in a super-speed whirlwind, generated by the Flash. Centrifugal forces tear Grodd's ships to pieces. As Grodd falls to the ground, King Solovar uses his psychic powers to freeze Grodd in a block of ice. In Gorilla City, King Solovar conducts a psychic examination of the Super-Gorilla.</p><p>He learns that Grodd sabotaged Operation Worldwash so that it would also erase all knowledge of Grodd, not just from the human race, but from the intelligent apes of Gorilla City, as well. The ""dreams"" King Solovar and the Flash endured were actually real encounters with Grodd, masquerading as the two heroes in each encounter. Grodd's scheme was undone when the Flash realized that his ""dream' had occurred far too slowly. Unbeknownst to Grodd, the Flash dreams in super-speed. Tipped off that something was afoot, the Flash contacted King Solovar. King Solovar mentally fortified them against Grodd's psychic manipulations, allowing them to win the day.</p><h3><ins>""By The Sea, By The Sea, By The Dangerous Sea!""</ins></h3><p>When Captain Hammer cuts the line to David Drake's bathysphere, Professor Martin Stein triggers the transformation into Firestorm, the Nuclear Man. Firestorm dives beneath the storm tossed waves, to retrieve the bathysphere. Firestorm guides the bathysphere back to the surface. Hammer, fearing for his position, shoots Drake, the moment the young scientist opens the hatch on the bathysphere. Enraged, Firestorm attacks Hammer, and all hands on Hammer's ship.</p><p>Seawater, pouring in from the open hatch, flood the bathysphere. The electrical systems short out, electrocuting Drake. After shackling Hammer and his crew, Firestorm races back to the bathysphere, to check on Drake's condition. The bathysphere explodes, just as Firestorm reaches it. Rising up from the wreckage, on a column of wind and water, is Drake, now transformed into something more than a mere man. Aggressively, the creature that once was Drake, lashes out at Firestorm.</p><p>Note: This issue contains already prepared material that was a result of the DC Implosion from the series <a

Allen conducts his search, as the Flash. Scouring the city for the Elongated Man, the Flash encounters a police car, hijacked by three circus performers. While Hocus, the magician, distracts the Flash, Scrunch, the dwarf, hits the Flash with the ""Hypno-Beeper"". Hocus exercises his hypnotic control over the Flash, by having the Scarlet Speedster spin around in place. Moving at super-speed, the Flash becomes a living drill, burrowing down deep into the Earth. The Flash is able to angle his body back upward.</p><p>Passing through a pocket of natural gas, however, cause the Flash to lose consciousness, upon reaching the surface. The circus performers turn over their stolen property, five milligrams of interferon, to their associate, Master Jero. Digging through their suitcases, Dibny discovers several newspaper clippings that may offer a clue, regarding the disappearance of her husband. The Elongated Man was trailing the Baxxum Brothers circus, as it toured through Europe. It's next destination... Central City. The Flash prowls around the fairgrounds, discovering the Elongated Man, catatonic, in a cage.</p><p>The Flash, moving faster than the eye can see, trails the trio of circus performers to their next robbery. Dibny also discovers her husband, and kisses him passionately, in an attempt to break him from his trance. After robbing another S.T.A.R. Labs facility of it's supply of interferon, the circus thieves are confronted by the Elongated Man. The Elongated Man snatches the interferon away from the Fat Lady, Blubba, and ensnares the group in his elongated arm. Suddenly the Flash arrives, and wrests the circus thieves from the Elongated Man's grip. The Elongated Man winds himself around the Flash, only to be unraveled by the Flash's super-speed spinning.</p><p>The Flash stops the fight, asking the Elongated Man to trust him. Master Jero distills a formula from the interferon, hoping to cure his neurofibromatosis. The potion, however, fails. The Elongated Man notes that Gingold extract is a part of Master Jero's formula. The Elongated Man offers to give Master Jero a blood transfusion, to transfer the Elongated Man's gingold-rich blood into Master Jero. The transfusion works, curing Master Jero of his neurofibromatosis. Though the circus thieves will have to stand trial for their crimes, the Flash and the Elongated Man will speak to the nobility of their motives, in the hopes of lightening their punishment.</p><h2><ins>Rain Rain Go Away... Come to Kill Us Another Day!</ins></h2><p>Over the South Pacific Ocean, Firestorm, the Nuclear Man squares off against the Human Typhoon. After striking Firestorm with a lightning bolt, the Human Typhoon attacks Captain Hunter's research vessel, sinking it. Firestorm rearranges the molecules of the ship wreckage into a serviceable raft for the crew. Firestorm tracks the Human Typhoon to Sydney, Australia. Firestorm attacks, only to be violently cast away. Following the advice of Professor Martin Stein's subconscious, Firestorm creates a massive iceberg beneath the Human Typhoon. Firestorm next creates an enormous fan. The combination of intense cold coupled with a change in the atmospheric pressure completely disrupts the Human Typhoon's physical body. His power dissipated, the Human Typhoon transforms back into David Drake, a young marine scientist.</p><p>Note: This issue contains already prepared material that was a result of the DC Implosion from the series <a href=""/firestorm-the-nuclear-man/4050-18409/"" data-ref-id=""4050-18409"">Firestorm</a>. </p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Wonder Woman in ""<strong>Old Gold</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21145,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469051-%24t2ec16dhjhyffk%28%2190cvbsvolj3nz%21~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",296,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55838/', 'id': 55838, 'name': 'Australia', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/australia/4020-55838/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55728/', 'id': 55728, 'name': 'Chicago', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/chicago/4020-55728/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-30759/', 'id': 30759, 'name': 'S.T.A.R.

Cold's Cold, Cold Flame!</ins></h3><p>Professor Henry and Nora Allen are en route to Central City, to visit their son, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. The Allens are run off the rode, narrowly avoiding a collision with another car. A trio of thieves commit a brazen daytime robbery. The thieves flee on their super-charged motorcycles. While the Flash takes down two of the thieves, the third man is stopped by Captain Cold. Though this is the tenth crime Captain Cold has thwarted, since earning his parole, the Flash still doesn't buy Captain Cold's conversion to good. The Flash, as Allen, is informed of his parent's car accident. At the hospital, Allen is told that his father will recover, but his mother has slipped into a coma.</p><p>Captain Cold, as Leonard Snart, spends time with the new love of his life, supermodel Myrna Troy. Allen's father blames himself for the accident. ""Captain Cold"" robs the Central City Jewelry Exchange. Upon returning home, ""Captain Cold"" is angrily confronted by Snart. Snart pulls back the hood on his uniform, revealing Troy. Snart has been betrayed. Troy committed the crimes, knowing Snart would take the fall. Dragging Troy by her hair, Snart makes plans to even the score. Allen learns of the jewel robbery. Allen, as the Flash, races over to Troy's estate, already surrounded by the S.W.A.T. team.</p><p>The Flash discovers Captain Cold and Troy, suspended in one of Captain Cold's death traps. A suicide note tells the Flash everything he needs to know. Unable to break through the bands of Captain Cold's ""Cold Fire"", the Flash vibrates, at super-human speed, deep into the Earth. Striking a pocket of magma, the molten rock is forced up to the surface, melting the ""Cold-Fire"" deathtrap. The Flash rushes Captain Cold, and Troy, to the hospital. Allen's father is released from the hospital. As Allen prepares his guest room for his father, he is unaware that his very own father is planning to murder him.</p><h3><ins>""Multiplex X Means Multiple-Choice...Death!""</ins></h3><p>Ronald Raymond is caught sketching in his notebook, during a lecture in English class. Raymond is asked to hand the notebook over, by his teacher. As Raymond reluctantly walks up to the front of the class, he is tripped by his classmate, Cliff Carmichael. The teacher intervenes to keep the two students from brawling. While all parties are distracted by the near altercation, Raymond's notebook disappears. The bell rings before the matter can be pursued further.</p><p>Out in the corridor, Doreen Day gives Raymond back his notebook. The two make plans to meet later, after Raymond's basketball practice. Professor Martin Stein works late, at Concordance Research Inc., to analyze the changes to his metabolism, since becoming one half of Firestorm, the Nuclear Man. Stein is assaulted by Multiplex. Stein has only recently become aware that Multiplex gained his powers in the same explosion that turned Stein, and Raymond, into Firestorm.</p><p>Multiplex has come to Concordance Research, Inc. to steal the prototype model of a new radar system. With Multiplex distracted, Stein initiates the transformation into Firestorm. At that moment, Raymond knocks himself unconscious, during basketball practice. This time when Firestorm forms, it is Stein who is in control, with Raymond acting as his subconscious. Stein is wholly unfamiliar with what action he should take as Firestorm. A problem he needs to resolve quickly, as Mulitplex moves in for the kill.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Batman in ""<strong>Hearts of Darkness</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21210,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469055-%24t2ec16zhjf8e9nnc8grubrpejs2wr%21~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",297,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}]","Capt.

Allen's father, Henry, is accosted in the hospital parking lot, by the young man that, accidentally, ran the Allen's off the road, putting Henry's wife into a coma. The Flash, as Allen, meets with his father. The doctor informs them that there has been no change in Mrs. Allen's condition. Suddenly, all the color drains from the room. Allen investigates, as the Flash.</p><p>The whole of Central City is affected by the strange phenomena. The Flash prevents several traffic accidents, caused by driver's lack of depth perception, due to the strange ""Black and White Out"". The Flash saves a group of children, playing in the park, from being hit by a broken helicopter rotor. As suddenly as it began, the phenomena ends. The Flash, as Allen, returns to work, where he is accosted by Frye. Expecting to be dressed down, Allen is surprised when Frye shows sympathy for Allen's situation.</p><p>Allen looks in on the current whereabouts of Roy G. Bivolo, the notorious Rainbow Raider. Allen, as the Flash, checks in on Bivolo, at a minimum security installation, just outside of Central City. The Flash is assured that Bivolo had nothing to do with the strange color draining phenomena. Unable to sleep, Allen is wide awake when the phenomena resumes. Allen investigates, again, as the Flash. A bolt of ebony lightning heralds the arrival of the Shade in Central City.</p><p>The Flash charges the Shade, only to be trapped within a swirling portal of abject darkness. Playing for time, the Flash inquires as to why the Shade has made the trip, between dimensions, to Earth-1. The Shade was about to embark on another crime spree, in Keystone City, when his weaponry was neutralized by intense bands of color, manifesting throughout the city. The Shade tracked the phenomena back to Earth-1. While the Shade has been talking, the Flash has been vibrating his molecules, at super-human speed, to work out an escape from the portal.</p><p>The Flash launches the Shade across Central City, like a missile. By the time the Flash catches up with the Shade, only his Ebony Cane remains. The Shade's voice emanates from the Ebony Cane. The Shade proposes that he and the Flash team-up, to resolve the issues created by the strange phenomena, as they affect them both. Bivolo reveals himself to be the culprit behind the phenomena. Allen's father plots his own son's death.</p><h3><ins>The Multiplex Complex</ins></h3><p>Inexplicably, Professor Martin Stein is in control of Firestorm, the Nuclear Man, with Ronald Raymond acting as his subconscious. Stein has little time to consider the situation, as he is under attack from Multiplex. Firestorm flees from his old enemy. Raymond reminds Steins that Multiplex is out to steal the prototype for a new radar guidance system. Reluctantly, Stein, as Firestorm, returns to the battle. Firestorm uses his nuclear-powered blasts to pop Mulitiplex's duplicates like soap bubbles.</p><p>While Firestorm is distracted with one group of duplicates, a second group ambushes him from behind, rendering him unconscious. Multiplex succeeds in taking the prototype, while also taking Firestorm captive. Firestorm uses his power to re-arrange molecules to easily escape his bonds. Firestorm binds Multiplex with power cables, that drain the energy from him, forcing him to recombine. With Multiplex subdued, Stein states his preference for Raymond being in control of Firestorm, with Stein as the subconscious guide.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Superman in ""<b>Gold Mine Rescue</b>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21269,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469056-%24t2ec16nhjike9qu3jcl9brpejrpbbw~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",298,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-40924/', 'id': 40924, 'name': 'Keystone City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keystone-city/4020-40924/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56310/', 'id': 56310, 'name': 'New York State', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-state/4020-56310/'}]",A Deadly Shade of Peril!

Allen's father, Henry, returns home. The condition of Allen's comatose mother has not changed. Roy G. Bivolo, the notorious Rainbow Raider, literally paints himself invisible, to escape from prison. Allen's father holds a gun to his son's head, while Allen sleeps. Though it would be a simple matter to murder his son, Allan's father stays his hand, opting instead to make Allen suffer.</p><p>Allen's father rouses Allen from slumber. Another ""Black &amp; White Out"" phenomena is occurring. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Bivolo steals a car. The Flash journeys to Keystone City, on Earth-2. There the ""Black and White Out"" phenomena manifests as bands of intense color, saturating the city. Having confirmed the Shade's story, the Flash returns to Central City, and Earth-1. The Flash agrees to team-up with the Shade, to solve the crisis. The Rainbow Raider stands upon a hillside, overlooking Central City.</p><p>Having absorbed all the color waves from Central City into an enormous prism, the Rainbow Raider bombards himself with the color waves. The Flash, with the Shade, discover the Rainbow Raider's Color Shifter, and Chromacolor Prism. The Rainbow Raider ambushes the Flash, hitting the Scarlet Speedster with a red beam that causes his molecules to start imploding. The Rainbow Raider reveals that he has succeeded in restoring his color vision.</p><p>The Flash uses the complete molecular control he holds over his own atoms, to reverse the effects of the Rainbow Raider's red beam. The Flash removes the Rainbow Raider's goggles, only to quickly learn that the Rainbow Raider no longer needs them to use his powers. The Flash is hit with an emerald hued beam, infusing his body with enormous, uncontrollable kinetic energy. While the Flash tries to burn the energy out of his system, the Shade takes the opportunity to strike.</p><p>The Flash suddenly becomes a living silhouette. The Rainbow Raider bathes the Flash in yellow energy, then switches to blue. The Shade's darkness field, however, protects the Flash from all of the Rainbow Raider's color wavelengths. The Flash beats the Rainbow Raider into unconsciousness, then shatters the Chromacolor Prism. The Shade, however, has escaped back to Earth-2. Allen's father receives a phone call from Police Captain Darryl Frye, inquiring as to Allen's whereabouts. Unbeknownst to either man, Allen, wrapped from head to toes in bandages, has, inexplicably, become a patient at the Morningside Clinic.</p><h3><ins>The Robbery</ins></h3><p>Bennie breaks into a wealthy couple's bedroom. Acting on information garnered from the maid, Bennie finds the safe, behind a picture, and opens it. Immediately, an alarm sounds. Bennie flees the scene, leaping into the getaway van. The driver, Sybil, tears off, with the police in hot pursuit. Sybil manages to lose the police, on the Triboro Bridge, when she veers off towards the East River Islands. At a toxic waste dumpsite, Bennie and Sybil steal one of the canisters, intending to extort money from the city for it.</p><p>Bennie feels the plan is somewhat outside of their wheelhouse, but Sybil convinces him to go through with it. Suddenly, their van begins floating in the air. Firestorm, the Nuclear Man, has transformed the van into a helium balloon. Firestrom delivers the two thieves to the nearest police precinct house. Firestorm then disposes of the canister of toxic waste. Had the two thieves not taken such a dangerous item, Firestorm would not have gotten involved. Bennie's fears, it seems, were justified.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Plastic Man in ""<strong>Gold for

Barry Allen awakens in a hospital after being doused in chemicals and struck by lightning to discover he never received super powers and never became the hero known as the Flash!</em></p><p>Doctor Petrou, an esteemed psychiatrist from Seattle, journeys to the Morningside Clinic, outside of Central City, to see a very special patient. Former police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, lies, paralyzed, in bed, bandaged from head to toe. After introducing himself to the sullen scientist, Petrou begins Allen's therapy. Petrou plays a recording of Allen, describing the accident, that led to Allen gaining the power of super-human speed. Allen adopted the costumed identity of the Flash. Allen recounts his first case, bringing the Turtle to justice. Petrou stops the tape.</p><p>Petrou asks Allen to imagine the night of the laboratory accident, that bestowed Allen's super-speed upon him, going another way. A lightning bolt did, in fact, strike a shelf of chemicals, dousing Allen, as he worked in the forensics laboratory. It did not, however, grant him super-powers. Allen was rushed to the hospital, his body covered in third degree chemical burns. Though Allen survived, his body was left in a state of paralysis. Allen's father arranged for Allen to be brought to the private Morningside Clinic, where his therapy began.</p><p>To escape the horrific trauma done to his body, Allen's damaged mind created a fantasy history. One wherein Allen, taking inspiration from his childhood hero, the Golden Age Flash, became the Silver Age Flash. To violently shake Allen from this fantasy, Petrou shreds Allen's Flash comic books before Allen's eyes. Allen screams in anguish, then begins weeping. Thus ends Allen's first session with Petrou. Allen, though, has feigned his emotional outburst. After Petrou leaves him, Allen, reflects on the history of the Golden Age Flash, their first case together, and their subsequent team-up with the legendary Justice Society Of America.</p><p>Allen wonders if Vandal Savage could be behind his current dilemma. Allen goes down the list of the Flash's Rogues Gallery, pondering which one of his enemies could be responsible for his situation. Is it all one of the MIrror Master's illusions? A trance brought on by the PIed Piper? Could Captain Boomerang or the Weather Wizard have done this to him? Allen's analysis of the Flash's Rogues Gallery is interrupted by Professor Ira West, Dexter Myles, and Wally West. Allen asks Professor West and Myles to leave, so that Allen can speak to West in private.</p><p>Allen attempts to convince West that West is the Flash's sidekick, Kid Flash. Allen recounts Kid Flash's origin, how the Flash altered Kid Flash's original costume, and how Kid Flash later helped found the Teen Titans. West leaves the room. Speaking with Professor West, and Myles, West sadly informs them that Allen is now including West in his delusions. Believing that Myles, and the Wests, may be under some villain's control, Allen considers the Super-Gorilla, Grodd, as a likely suspect. Allen recalls his adventures in Gorilla City, meeting King Solovar, and thwarting Grodd.</p><p>Allen narrows the list of suspects to those villains that know Allen is the Flash. Abra Kadabra? Heat Wave? Captain Cold? The Golden Glider? Allen's reverie is broken by the arrival of two very special visitors, the Green Lantern and the Elongated Man. Allen tries, futilely, to convince both heroes that they've shared adventures with Allen, as the Flash. Allen's intimate knowledge of the Green Lantern's secret identity, and the Elongated Man's origins, however, are easily explained away. After the two heroes depart, Allen, for the first time, begins to doubt his life as the Flash.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Allen, he is observed by Petrou. Desperate to shore up his belief in himself as the Flash, Allen continues to go down the list of possible suspects, responsible for his current dilemma. Could it be Mister Element, or Doctor Alchemy? Perhaps, the Trickster? Or even, the Rainbow Raider? One villain Allen is certain is<em> not </em>involved is Professor Zoom, the Reverse Flash. Allen recalls how Professor Zoom murdered Allen's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West. After an epic battle, Allen, as the Flash, left Professor Zoom on a one way journey to the beginning of time itself, and beyond.</p><p>Professor Zoom could not have survived the trip. Suddenly, Allen's mind is brought back to the present. Iris West stands before him....alive. West reveals that, though she waited a long time for Allen to recover, she ended up marrying Allen's best friend, from college. They have two children. The revelation leaves Allen laughing hysterically. Petrou informs Allen that his paralysis is psychosomatic. As Allen begins to come to grips with the truth, his mobility is slowly being restored. Petrou offers to bring Professor Zoom in to see Allen.</p><p>Once Allen sees that Professor Zoom is alive and well, Allen will have to concede that his entire life as the Flash has been a fiction. Allen agrees to the meeting. Petrou, surrounded by the staff of the Morningside Clinic, as well as all of Allen's myriad visitors, conjures up Professor Zoom, out of ""Proto-Gases"". The group bursts into a round of applause, congratulating Petrou on his brilliant scheme. Petrou brings Professor Zoom into Allen's room. To prove his identity, Professor Zoom removes Allen's bandages, at super-human speed. Allen's paralysis immediately fades away.</p><p>To everyone's astonishment, the Flash suddenly appears at Allen's door. Allen moves from the bed to the door and back, moving so fast that he can literally carry on a conversation with himself, as the Flash. The Flash spins Petrou around at super-human speed, revealing Petrou to be Abra Kadabra. The Flash reveals the fatal flaw in Abra Kadabra's scheme, before he returns the 64th Century magician to prison. If the Flash had never existed, as Abra Kadabra tried to convince Allen, then how could there ever have been a Reverse Flash? The very existence of Professor Zoom proved to Allen, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he was, in fact, the Flash.</p><p>As part of the anniversary celebration, Fred Hembeck illustrated a special ""Flash-Grams"", looking back on a few of the more outlandish transformations the Flash has suffered, over the past 25 years.</p>",,,,,,,False,21410,"{'icon_url':

And the Beat Goes Off!</ins></h3><p>Police Captain Darryl Frye is abducted by a thug, hiding in the backseat of Frye's car. Police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, returns to the police laboratory, after an unexplained three day absence, to find that he has been fired. His assistant, Patty Spivot, is crestfallen. Allen receives word, from his father, Professor Henry Allen, that Allen's mother, Nora, has awoke from her coma. Allen rushes to the hospital to visit his mother. Spivot contacts Allen, informing him of Frye's abduction. Allen investigates, as the Flash. Eavesdropping outside the Fryes' window, the Flash learns that Frye has a pacemaker.</p><p>At a medical supply company, the Flash finds out the specific type of pacemaker Frye has, then attunes his vibratory signature to the same frequency. The Flash runs down all the owners of that specific type of pacemaker, in a one hundred mile radius. After saving a construction worker from a falling girder, the Flash finally tracks the pacemaker signal back to Frye. The Flash discovers Frye in a catatonic state. After rounding up Frye's kidnappers, The Flash takes Frye to a hospital. Frye is given a clean bill of health and released.</p><p>The Flash, as Allen, learns the identities of Frye's abductors, from Detective Frank Curtis. The identity of one man, that of nuclear terrorist Philo ""Nukes"" Malloy, troubles Allen. Allan theorizes that arresting Malloy may not have put a stop to his sinister deeds. Allen, as the Flash, whisks Frye away, from a demonstration of a new nuclear detection unit. The Flash reveals, to Frye, that Malloy installed a miniature nuclear explosive inside Frye's pacemaker. The explosive was set to detonate during the demonstration of the nuclear detection unit.</p><p>Malloy hoped that the explosion would be blamed on a malfunction in the unit, thereby discrediting any future use of it. As the explosive detonates in Frye's chest, the Flash begins vibrating the molecules of both men, at super-human speed, into intangibility. The explosion passes harmlessly through them. The Flash informs Frye that Allen was instrumental in figuring out Malloy's scheme. In gratitude, Frye reinstates Allen on the police force. The Flash, as Allen, visits with his mother. Meanwhile, Allen's father, Henry, is locked in a passionate embrace with Lisa Snart, the notorious Golden Glider. Henry assures Snart that Allen will soon be dead.</p><h3><ins>""How Laughs the Hyena?""</ins></h3><p>The Hyena stalks the subways of New York City. Ronald Raymond and Doreen Day are en route to the movies, when Cliff Carmichael crashes their date. Raymond and Carmichael begin trading barbs, infuriating Day. The trio come across five street toughs, beating up a kid. Day insists they intervene. Carmichael flees the scene. Day draws the gang's attention. As they move in to assault Day and Raymond, they are attacked by the Hyena. After the gang has been brutally subdued by the Hyena, a pair of transit officers close in.</p><p>The Hyena viciously mauls the transit officers, before leaping in front of a subway train. Raymond escorts Day home, then goes to consult with nuclear physicist, Professor Martin Stein. Raymond and Stein trigger the transformation that combines them into Firestorm, the Nuclear Man. Firestorm uses his atomic restructuring power to create an energy phantom from the Hyena's body heat residue. Firestorm follows the phantom Hyena back to Day's house. Firestorm is left with the chilling realization that the Hyena may be a member of the Day family.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad ""<strong>Wonder Woman vs the Robot Master</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21484,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469098-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",301,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56310/', 'id': 56310, 'name': 'New York State', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-state/4020-56310/'}]",...

Police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, reveals to his father, that he is the Flash. The Flash attends a ceremony, honoring him with a commemorative statue. As soon as the statue is unveiled, it's bombarded with acid-filled jewels. With the statue rapidly dissolving, the Flash races after the culprit, the Golden Glider. Screams from the crowd turn the Flash back. Giant daggers plummet towards the innocent bystanders. After moving the onlookers to safety, the Flash generates an immense amount of friction heat, drawing the daggers towards him. At the last moment, the Flash vibrates into the ground, to avoid the impact.</p><p>With the crowd cheering him on, the Flash closes in on the Golden Glider. As he grows near, the Flash starts to slow down. Then, before the outraged eyes of the crowd, the Flash passionately kisses the Golden Glider. The Flash then races off with the Golden Glider. Detective Frank Curtis spies Professor Henry Allen escorting a beautiful young woman around Central City. Curtis is shocked to discover that his best friend's father is having an affair. Unbeknownst to Curtis, the elder Allen is involved with Lisa Snart, the Golden Glider. Curtis tails the pair, surreptitiously taking photographs of them from afar. At home, Allen and his father, catch up on the news of the day.</p><p>Central City has turned against the Flash, for cavorting about with a criminal like the Golden Glider. The elder Allen suggests that the Golden Glider might strike at a the opening of Jayston's Jewelry Mart. Allen, as the Flash, agrees to stake it out. The elder Allen contacts Snart, to inform her that the Flash has taken the bait. Snart, as the Golden Glider follows through on the robbery, but the Flash never shows. Across town, the Flash is kicking millions of pebbles, at super-human speed, over the city. The gravel barrage narrowly misses the Golden Glider. It is followed by gobs of hot tar, also churned up by the Scarlet Speedster.</p><p>The Flash fills the air around the Golden Glider with powdered concrete. Plugging a hose into a nearby fire hydrant, the Flash brings the Golden Glider down, with a high-presssure jet of water. Mired in tar and gravel, with the concrete quickly setting in her uniform, the Golden Glider is subdued. A quick burst from the hose dislodges her mask, and the hypnotic jewel embedded in it, that the Golden Glider used to control the Flash. The Golden Glider is taken away by the proper authorities. Curtis' photographs confirm that Henry Allen is having an affair with a younger woman. At that moment, the elder Allen is inexplicably dressed in the costume of the Flash's deceased adversary, the Top. The elder Allen, believing himself to be the Top, vows to get his love, the Golden Glider, back.</p><h3><ins>Invitation To Revelation</ins></h3><p>Firestorm, the Nuclear Man, has tracked the Hyena back to Doreen Day's house. Uneasily, Firestorm sneaks into the Day household, to surreptitiously investigate the connection. Firestorm is disturbed by the decor of Summer Day's bedroom. Though Summer is a grown woman, her bedroom is decorated as if she were still a small child. Firestorm discovers Summer's diary. Before the Nuclear Man can decide on a course of action, the Hyena bursts into the room.</p><p>Firestorm attempts to flee, flying out the window, but the Hyena catches him. With the Hyena clawing at him, Firestorm unleashes a powerful nuclear blast, that dislodges the Hyena from his person. Fearing he may have killed the Hyena, Firestorm pursues the falling body. With incredible acrobatic prowess, the Hyena doubles back and resumes the attack on Firestorm. This time it is the Nuclear Man who falls from up high, plummeting into the Harlem River. Firestorm's unconscious body surfaces, right in the path of an oncoming garbage scow.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, Batman in ""<b>Lights...Camera...Crime!</b>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21557,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469106-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",302,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}]","""Lisa Starts With An L and That Stands For Lethal""/Invitation To Revelation","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60268/', 'id': 60268, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Jewels"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-jewels/4055-60268/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57075/', 'id': 57075, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Skates"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-skates/4055-57075/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-11342/', 'id': 11342, 'name': 'Bob Smith', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bob-smith/4040-11342/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-11908/', 'id': 11908, 'name': 'Denys Cowan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/denys-cowan/4040-11908/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40871/', 'id': 40871, 'name': 'Gerry Conway', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gerry-conway/4040-40871/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41455/', 'id': 41455, 'name': 'Mike W.

Later, Detective Frank Curtis confronts Allan, with photographs of Allan's father, Professor Henry Allen, clearly having an affair with a younger woman. Allen refuses to believe it. Entering his apartment, Allen walks right into a death trap. Vibrating his molecules, at super-human speed, into intangibility, Allen evades the spring-loaded blade. Building up immense heat friction, Allen vaporizes the spring-loaded drill, then shatters the spiked balls. A pre-recorded tape, from Allen's father, reveals himself to be the culprit.</p><p>Taking a closer look at Curtis' photographs, Allen recognizes the young woman, his father is having an affair with, as Lisa Snart, the notorious Golden Glider. Allen confronts Snart, in the Central City lock-up, but garners no new information. Working in the laboratory with his assistant, Patty Spivot, Allen finds the outside corridor filling with gas. Allen, as the Flash, expels the gas, out of a window, revealing a top-shaped delivery device. The Flash races to Snart's cell, only to find a sonic-emitting top has shattered the outside wall. Snart is gone. The Flash easily catches up to Snart.</p><p>Professor Henry Allen accosts the Flash, dressed in the costume of the long-deceased Top. The Flash begins violently shaking Snart, at super-human speed, demanding to know what she's done to his father. The Flash is brought down by an electro-top, allowing Snart and Professor Allen to flee the scene. Outside Allen's mother's hospital room, Allen is accosted by Jack Morgan, the man responsible for the automobile accident, that put Allen's parents in the hospital. Morgan reveals that Allen's father was dead at the scene, but Morgan was able to revive him, through cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p><p>Allen, as the Flash, visits the Institute For Paranormal Phenomena. There the Flash confirms his hypothesis that while his father lay dead, the ghost of the Top took possession of his body. Back at home, the Flash, as Allen, is contacted by the Golden Glider, via one of her special gemstones. Allen, as the Flash, follows the jewel, into another death trap. Locked into a centrifugal treadmill, the Flash is forced to run, at ever increasing speed, as it spins. The Top possessed Professor Allen holds a gun to his head. Using the centrifugal force as a boost to his own super-human speed, the Flash breaks loose from the treadmill.</p><p>Before the bullet can leave the chamber, the Flash fuses the barrel shut, with super-speed generated friction heat. The strain of his exertions prove too much for the Flash, who keels over from a heart attack. The Golden Glider sees the Flash's spirit rising from his body. The Top abandons Professor Allen's body, to take possession of the Flash. The Golden Glider embraces the Flash passionately, only to discover that he faked his death. After the Flash subdues the Golden Glider, he checks on Professor Allen. Sure enough, when the Top abandoned Professor Allen's body, Professor Allen's spirit was able to reclaim it anew. Upon regaining consciousness, Professor Allen's first thought is of his wife, confirming for the Flash that his father has truly come home.</p><h3><ins>""The Hyena Syndrome!""</ins></h3><p>Firestorm, the Nuclear Man, lies unconscious, in the path of an oncoming garbage scow. Professor Martin Stein tries to wrest control of Firestorm to no avail. His psychic efforts, though, prove enough to rouse Firestorm back to consciousness. Firestorm destroys the scow as he blasts his way through it, then restores it to it's original condition, with his atomic restructuring powers. Firestorm recovers Summer Day's diary, which he lost in his battle with the Hyena.</p><p>Day's sister, Doreen, finds her sprawled out on her bed, burning with fever. The information Firestorm garners from Day's diary chills him to the bone. He immediately races for Day's home. Doreen returns to her sister bedroom, with a cold compress and a glass of water, Doreen is puzzled by the absence of light, as she enters the room, Suddenly, the bedroom door slams shut behind Doreen, as she is confronted by the Hyena.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad Red Tornado in ""<strong>Clean Sweep</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21632,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469108-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",303,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}]","The Top Is Alive And Well In Henry Allen!/""The Hyena Syndrome!""","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60268/', 'id': 60268, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Jewels"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-jewels/4055-60268/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57075/', 'id': 57075, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Skates"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-skates/4055-57075/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58441/', 'id': 58441, 'name': ""Top's Trick Tops"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tops-trick-tops/4055-58441/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-32171/', 'id': 32171, 'name': 'Adrian Gonzales', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/adrian-gonzales/4040-32171/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-11342/', 'id': 11342, 'name': 'Bob Smith', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bob-smith/4040-11342/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40871/', 'id': 40871, 'name': 'Gerry Conway', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gerry-conway/4040-40871/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41455/', 'id': 41455, 'name': 'Mike W.

Allen gives Nathan a ""Captain Computron"" toy. Willard Wiggins, the owner of the Wiggins Toy Corporation, awards the toy's designer, Basil Nerblin, a cash bonus. Nerblin's wife, Francine, is outraged that Nerblin has been given, and accepted, such a paltry sum for his brilliance. That night, a digital being exits Nathan's ""Captain Computron"" toy. Alerted to the noise, Nathan's father, Mack, confronts the strange being, and is subdued. The sound of an explosion brings Allen running, as the Flash.</p><p>After dousing the flames in Nathan's apartment, the Flash takes off after the digital intruder.The Flash loses the trail, at a street lamp, where the strange creature converted itself into pure electricity, to escape. Allen is asked to fix the ""Captain Computron"" toy, as it has ceased to function. Allen discovers a cluster of micro-components that seem to serve no function in the toy. Allen receives a call from the toy's seller. The toy purchased for Nathan was actually a special model, meant for Wiggins' son. Allen agrees to bring the toy back.</p><p>His suspicions raised, Allen decides to investigate the matter, as the Flash. Wiggins discovers Colonel Computron waiting for him, in his den. Wiggins is abducted. The Flash discovers the break-in at Wiggins. and tracks him back to the International Toy Symposium. Colonel Computron brings Wiggins before a gigantic video game screen. Colonel Computron levels a strange weapon at Wiggins, only to have the Flash take the shot. The Flash is digitized, reappearing on the video screen.</p><p>Transformed into living electronic impulses, the Flash is bereft of his super-human speed, and under assault from Colonel Computron's digital minions. Using his complete control over his own molecular structure, the Flash is able to escape from the video screen, and rematerialize back into flesh and blood. Colonel Computron flees. The Flash frees Wiggins. Nerblin jokingly accuses his wife of being Colonel Computron, when, in all likelihood, Nerblin, himself, is the Flash's newest adversary.</p><h2>The Heart is the Hunter</h2><p>Doreen Day is accosted by the Hyena, in her sister's bedroom. Firestorm, the Nuclear Man, tackles the Hyena, and the two begin fighting. At the sound of Day's parents, outside the bedroom door, the Hyena flees. Firestorm hands Summer Day's diary over to her father, then takes off in pursuit of the Hyena. Reading Summer's diary, the Day family learn that Summer, is, in fact, the Hyena. Summer's father, Bert, had always resented Summer, simply for the fact that she was not a boy. Summer excelled in many activities trying to win her father's love, eventually following him into the police force.</p><p>When Summer failed the academy, the disappointment in her father's eyes drove her into a rage. After destroying all of her trophies, Summer joined the Peace Corps, ending up in Africa. One night, Summer was drawn to a native's distress. Investigating, Summer was bitten by the man. Responding to her screams, the camp guide discovered a were-hyena standing over Summer, and gunned it down. Shortly after returning to the states, Summer suffered her first transformation into the Hyena. Summer tried to exercise self-control over her bestial mind by attacking criminals. Her hatred for her father, though, transferred her rage to all police officers, too.</p><p>As the Hyena, Summer was just as likely to attack cops, as she was crooks. The Days had Summer committed to a psychiatric facility in Arizona, but the doctors believed her stories of transforming into a were -hyena to be delusions. The Day family is horrified at the revelations brought to light in Summer's diary. Firestorm engages the Hyena in combat, near Central Park. Using his atomic restructuring powers, Firestorm uses a bit of psychological warfare, to convince the Hyena that her family loves her. With her rage abated, the Hyena transforms back into Summer, who is taken to a hospital, her future...uncertain.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad, The Penguin in ""<strong>Penguins on Parade</strong>""</p></li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21696,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469111-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21p8fims%21%2By%2Blbse1bjhm6%21~~60_3.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",304,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}]",One More Blip and You're Dead/The Heart Is The Hunter,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-11342/', 'id': 11342, 'name': 'Bob Smith', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bob-smith/4040-11342/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-40871/', 'id': 40871, 'name': 'Gerry Conway', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gerry-conway/4040-40871/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30024/', 'id': 30024, 'name': 'Jerry Serpe', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerry-serpe/4040-30024/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41455/', 'id': 41455, 'name': 'Mike W.

Police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, has a nightmare of Garrick, perishing in an avalanche. Disturbed, Allen, as the Flash, journeys to Earth-2, to check on Garrick. The Flash materializes, on Earth-2, in the middle of a burning building. After putting the fire out, the Flash heads for Garrick's home. The Golden Age Flash arrives home, to find his Silver Age counterpart waiting for him. The Golden Age Flash confirms his counterpart's worst fears... Garrick is missing. As events on Earth-1 and Earth-2 tend to parallel one another, the Flash fears that Garrick will die, as <em>his</em> wife did on Earth-1. The Golden Age Flash suspects a criminal gang, known as ""The Ravagers"".</p><p>The Golden Age Flash opens a drawer, to provide evidence of their involvement, setting off a chain reaction that destroys Garrick's home. Only by vibrating their molecules, at super-human speed, into intangibility, are the two Flashes able to survive the explosion unscathed. Fingerprints, off a fuse relay, lead the Flashes to the mountain range, a few miles outside of Keystone City. Discovering the Ravagers' secret lair, the Golden Age Flash requests to go in alone. In a rage, the Golden Age Flash razes the Ravagers' lair to the ground. Only the intervention of the Silver Age Flash keeps his counterpart from killing the Ravagers' leader. Suddenly the Ravagers disappear, courtesy of Doctor Fate.</p><p>Doctor Fate reveals that a mystic force, drawing power from the Orb of Nabu, was responsible for Garrick's disappearance. Doctor Fate reveals Garrick's journey. The Silver Age Flash is horrified to see his dream come to life. Garrick, though, does not die in the avalanche. Garrick has been spirited away to Limbo, where the laws of nature and physics do not apply. Doctor Fate has never been able to penetrate the barrier surrounding Limbo, and thus is powerless to retrieve Garrick. With Doctor Fate's assistance, the two Flash are able to align their vibratory signature with Limbo, but once they go in, Doctor Fate cannot get them out. The Flashes quickly locate Garrick, as well as the other time travelers, still being held prisoner in Limbo.</p><p>The Lord Of Limbo revels himself. The Golden Age Flash violently assaults the Lord of Limbo, only to realize he has just attacked the Silver Age Flash. The Lord of Limbo vanishes, his taunting laughter ringing in the Flashes' ears. After conferring with Garrick, the Flashes realize that the Lord of Limbo brought her to Limbo through a portal. Said portal may be a possible means of escape. The Silver Age Flash hurls a rock into the portal, only to see it disintegrate. The portal is clearly only one way. Working together, the Scarlet Speedsters race along the swirling outer wall of the portal, reversing it's direction. Their success is confirmed by the image of Doctor Fate, beckoning to them from the other side. The Flashes begin sending the prisoners of Limbo through the portal.</p><p>The Silver Age Flash forcibly sends his counterpart through the portal. As the final alien leaps into the portal, the Silver Age Flash tackles him. The alien is revealed to be the Lord of Limbo, himself, ironically also a prisoner in Limbo.The Silver Age Flash struggles with the Lord of Limbo on the threshold of the portal. Doctor Fate fires a mystic bolt through the portal. Believing it to be an attack, the Lord of Limbo hurls the Silver Age Flash into the path of Doctor Fate's mystic bolt. The bolt, however, was merely a means to transport the Silver Age Flash back to Earth-2.

Allen is astonished to see Samuel Scudder, the notorious Mirror Master, performing in a dance contest. Scudder, as the Mirror Master, puts the crowd in stasis, so he can steal a glittering disco globe. Allen, as the Flash, confronts the Mirror Master. The Mirror Master reflects a beam of solid light into the Flash's back, giving him time to escape, through a mirror, with the globe. The Flash vibrates through the mirror as well, ending up in a back alley.The Mirror Master has escaped.</p><p>In his secret lair, the Mirror Master speaks with Narcissa, a beautiful Atlantean woman trapped inside an ancient mirror. The Mirror Master has a plan to free her, by having the Flash take her place. The Flash, as Allen, analyzes the mirror the Mirror Master escaped through, with his assistant, Patty Spivot. Allen's analysis is inconclusive. The Mirror Master goes on a crime spree, always escaping the Flash through a mirror. To discern how the Mirror Master is pulling off his escapes, the Flash begins altering his vibratory frequency, each time he runs through a mirror.</p><p>The Mirror Master abducts the Mayor of Central City. The Flash tracks the Mirror Master back to Sol's Haberdasher, momentarily falling prey to one of the Mirror Master's illusions. The Flash is on the verge of apprehending the Mirror Master, when the villian informs the Flash that the mayor is in a death trap. The Mayor is on the verge of being incinerated, when the Flash arrives to rescue him. The Mirror Master, though, has taken the opportunity to escape. Back in his hidden lair, the Mirror Master listens to Narcissa's tale.</p><p>Narcissa escaped the sinking of Atlantis by transporting herself into an ancient mirror. The destruction of Atlantis, however, was so total that the machines needed to pull her back out were lost. The Mirror Master smuggled the ancient Atlantean mirror into the states, never suspecting that it contained the beautiful Narcissa. Falling in love with her, the Mirror Master used his extensive knowledge of mirrors to try to release her. Though the Mirror Master ultimately failed, he did learn how to teleport himself through mirrors. By triangulating the angle the Mirror Master entered the mirrors to escape, the Flash tracks the Mirror Master to the Wheating Glass Works.</p><p>The Mirror Master immediately leaps into a mirror to escape, but this time the Flash follows him. Knowing the Flash has hit upon the proper vibratory frequency to enter Narcissa's mirror, the Mirror Master begins to draw the Flash towards it. The Flash ceases vibrating, causing him to crash into the mirror, shattering it. With the love of his life lost, the Mirror Master falls to his knees, weeping inconsolably. Unaware of what has happened, the Flash tries to comfort the Mirror Master.</p><h3><ins>Apocalypse of The Fifth Sun!</ins></h3><p>Doctor Fate enters the Boston Museum of Natural History, finding two security guards preparing to sacrifice the curator, to the Aztec God, Totec. Inza Nelson tries writing a novel of her life, as the wife of Doctor Fate. Nelson has become increasingly unhappy with sharing her husband, Kent, with the Lord Of Order, Nabu. When Kent felt the call to action, Nelson tried, futilely, to convince Kent to abandon his role as Doctor Fate.</p><p>Kent, though, felt duty bound to put on the Helmet of Fate, and address the latest crisis. Nelson recalls Kent's history with Nabu. As a child, Kent had been taken on an archaeological expedition to the Valley Of Ur, by his father, Sven. Kent unwittingly freed Nabu from suspended animation, releasing a poison gas that killed Kent's father. Nabu took Kent under his wing, and trained him in the mystic arts.</p><p>At the end of Kent's apprenticeship, Nabu's mortal shell fell away, revealing his true appearance, as a Lord of Order. Nabu infused his essence into a golden helmet, which, when worn by Kent, transformed him into Doctor Fate. Unwilling to allow Kent to face the unknown danger alone, Nelson leaves the Tower of Fate, and drives to Boston.</p><p>With the sacrificial ritual complete, the stone statue of Totec comes to life, as the old God returns to the mortal world. Doctor Fate attempts to cast Totec out, but the old God is not so easily removed. Nelson enters the fray, quickly being subdued by Totec, who then uses Nelson to dispatch Doctor Fate. With both Nelson and Doctor Fate his prisoners, nothing remains to stop Totec from ushering in the apocalypse.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad

Their helicopter is carrying an enormous tribal gong, to the Centrex Museum. The Pied Piper orders the helicopter pilot to fly the gong into the steel skeleton, of an under-construction skyscraper. As luck would have it, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is on the street, and takes action, as the Flash. The gong is released into the center of the steel skeleton. As it impacts with the steel girders, a powerful sonic wave is released, incapacitating the steel workers. Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flash catches the gong, and vibrates it's molecules into intangibility.</p><p>Letting go of the gong, it rematerializes around two steel girders, stopping it's fall. During the entire calamity, the Pied Piper has been recording the sonic waves of the gong. A Picture News reporter, Marcy Dunphy, is abducted, right outside of Central City police headquarters. Dunphy was gathering information on Henry Darrow, the Pied Piper. The Pied Piper collects the sonic waves given off by an avalanche. Dunphy's abductors turn out to be Hazel and Osgood Rathaway. The Flash is alerted to a robbery, at the Centrex Museum, being carried out by the Pied Piper. The Rathaways give Dunphy some history on their son, Hartley.</p><p>Born deaf, the Rathaways spent untold sums on doctors to restore Hartley's hearing. Once accomplished, Hartley proved to have an aptitude for music. The Rathaways felt that young Hartley would add prestige to their name, perhaps by becoming a world-renouned symphony conductor. Hartley's interests, though, ran contrary to those dreams. The Flash easily penetrates the Pied Piper's sonic shield, surrounding the Centrex Museum. Upon doing so, however, the Flash's head starts ringing with the sound of a hundred bells. Momentarily incapacitated, the Flash is easy prey for the Pied Piper.</p><p>Hartley learned he could control the minds of other by playing certain sonic frequencies. Longing for a real challenge in his life, Hartley took on the mantle of the Pied Piper, and embarked on a life of crime. The Rathaways spent a small fortune covering up their son's criminal identity, to protect their family name. going so far as to have Hartley's name legally changed to ""Henry Darrow"". The Pied Piper converts the Flash's body into pure sound. With the Flash defeated, the Pied Piper completes his robbery, and walks calmly out of the museum. Protected by a sonic force field, the Pied Piper has nothing to fear from the police officers surrounding the museum.</p><p>The Rathaways abducted Dunphy, because her investigation was getting too close to uncovering the truth about the Rathaways' son. As if on cue, the Pied Piper enters the room. The Flash manages to hold himself together, long enough to ricochet off of several buildings, creating a series of echoes that eventually culminate in a sonic boom. Inexplicably, this action restores the Flash to normal. The Pied PIper turns his ill-gotten gains over to his parents, remittance for all the money they spent, trying to mold him into the man they wanted him to be. The Flash arrives and subdues the Pied Piper. The Rathaways break down. Dunphy's investigation has come to it's conclusion.</p><h3><ins>Twilight Of The Fifth Sun</ins></h3><p>Doctor Fate, and Inza Nelson, are being held captive by Totec, the Aztec God Of War. In reality, Totec is really Malferrazae, a Lord Of Chaos. Malferrazae mystically transports himself, and his captives, from the Boston Museum of Natural History to Mexico City. Malferrazae intend to bring about the destruction of the world, then to recreate it in his image.</p><p>Malferrazae mystically transforms Mexico City, and it's populace, to the way it appeared 400 years ago, when Malferrazae last walked the Earth. Mexico City has become the Aztec city, Tenochtitlan. Malferrazae transports Doctor Fate to the Aztec city, Coatepec, to face Malferrazae's re-animated legions of undead. Nelson is allowed to watch Doctor Fate's struggle with Malferrazae's forces.</p><p>Nelson silently berates herself for allowing her jealousy of her husband's shared life with the Lord Of Order, Nabu, as Doctor Fate, to bring them to this peril. Doctor Fate transforms the very sand beneath his feat into an epic monstrosity, that quickly subdues Malferrazae's legions. Drawn to Nelson's jealously, Malferrazae draws the powerful emotion from her, molding it into a horrific adversary, to send against Doctor Fate. As Nelson's jealousy is a part of her, should Doctor Fate destroy the creature, he will also be killing Nelson.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>This issue contains the Hostess Superhero Ad Batman in ""<strong>The Canine Caper</strong>""</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,21977,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3466876-%24t2ec16jhjhqe9nzeyo%2Crbrpem8otbg~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",307,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-57365/', 'id': 57365, 'name': 'Mexico City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mexico-city/4020-57365/'}]",Prey For The Piper/Twilight Of The Fifth Sun,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-47344/', 'id': 47344, 'name': 'Amulet of Anubis', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/amulet-of-anubis/4055-47344/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56063/', 'id': 56063, 'name': 'Helmet of Fate', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/helmet-of-fate/4055-56063/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-11342/', 'id': 11342, 'name': 'Bob Smith', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bob-smith/4040-11342/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5584/', 'id': 5584, 'name': 'Dick Giordano', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dick-giordano/4040-5584/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6536/', 'id': 6536, 'name': 'Keith Giffen', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keith-giffen/4040-6536/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2109/', 'id': 2109, 'name': 'Larry Mahlstedt', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/larry-mahlstedt/4040-2109/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41153/', 'id': 41153, 'name': 'Martin Pasko', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/martin-pasko/4040-41153/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41455/', 'id': 41455, 'name': 'Mike W.

Dean arrives, in Central City, to pay Allen a visit. Dean is troubled by a series of letters she has been receiving from a twisted admirer. The letters have been written by Lance Basilla, who has obsessed over Dean since they were children. Dean calls Allen in a panic. An intruder is trying to break into her hotel room. Allen races to Dean's rescue, as the Flash. Hearing Dean's screams coming from the elevator, the Flash races down the elevator shaft.</p><p>The moment the Flash sets foot on the elevator, a strange energy discharge severs the elevator cable. Vibrating his molecules at super-human speed, the Flash passes through the elevator walls, grabs Dean, then races them both to safety, before the elevator car hits bottom. Thousands of miles away, a pair of scientist, at the Munford Sleep Research Center, monitor Basilla's dreams. Allen recalls an old memory of Basilla, as a mummy, bullying him. The encounter ended when Basilla was hit by lightning. Dean pulls Allen out of his reverie.</p><p>Escorting Dean around Central City, Allen is accosted by Basilla, once again clad as a mummy. The doctors postulate the idea that Basilla's dream images may, in fact, be happening in reality. Basilla attacks Allen, then lurches towards Dean. Allen steals Dean away from Basilla, as the Flash. Some post traumatic stress, left over from the days Allen was bullied by Basilla, paralyzes the Flash with fear.  At the sound of thunder, the Flash runs, multiple times, through Basilla, giving Basilla's atoms a positive charge, attracting a lightning strike. Basilla immediately awakens, at the research center, and bolts from the laboratory. Basilla writes Dean one final letter, promising to never trouble her again.</p><h3><ins>Dawn Of The Sixth Sun</ins></h3><p>Doctor Fate is locked in combat with the physical incarnation of Inza Nelson's jealousy, given monstrous form by the Lord Of Chaos, Malferrazae.  Calling upon the power of God, Doctor Fate backs the creature off of him.The creature changes shape, becoming more feminine in appearance. Doctor Fate begins a running battle with the creature, that carries them to California, and beyond. While Doctor Fate is momentarily incapacitated, the creatures triggers an enormous earthquake.</p><p>Doctor Fate manages to imprison Nelson's jealousy. Doctor Fate summons the crystal Orb of Nabu, before taking further action. Doctor Fate peers into the orb, and sees the future. Should Doctor Fate destroy the creature, Nelson, too, will die. The death of Nelson would cause Doctor Fate's human host, Kent Nelson, to refuse to ever take up the mantle of Doctor Fate again. With the Lord Of Order removed, none would bar Malferrazae from destroying the world, then reshaping it in his image.</p><p>Doctor Fate steals Nelson's body away from Malferrazae, to rejoin her to her jealousy. While distracted by this task, the creature changes shape again, becoming a triple-headed serpent. Slithering out of Doctor Fate's trap, Nelson's jealousy wrenches the Helmet of Nabu from Doctor Fate's head, severing the Lord of Order's connection to Kent Nelson. With Doctor Fate's spell broken, Nelson plunges to her death.  Kent Nelson, as if awaking from a dream, spies the lifeless body of his wife in the wreckage.

Police Captain, Darryl Frye, and police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, are running in the park. Allen shoves Frye out of the way, when Kryad's ship nearly collides with them. Kryad abducts Allen, while altering Frye's memories of the morning's events. Allen, as the Flash, brings Kryad's ship to a full stop. Kryad reveals himself, and his origins as a time traveler. Kryad had come back in time to steal the Green Lantern's Power Ring, but was unable to make contact with the Emerald Gladiator. Kryad has now decided to steal the Flash's super-human speed, a process that will kill the Flash.</p><p>The Flash suddenly finds himself paralyzed, allowing Kryad the opportunity to begin the power stealing process. The Flash concentrates on speeding up his heart rate, accelerating his blood cells, setting off a chain reaction, that frees him from the paralysis field. Kryad is quickly subdued. Having glimpsed Kryad's motivation for coming back in time, while in telepathic contact with him, the Flash offers his aid. The Flash, and Kryad, head back further in time, to the night an incredible laboratory accident created the Flash. After watching history repeat itself, the Flash and Kryad collect Allen's chemical-drenched lab coat. Kryad extracts the necessary molecules from the lab coat, to endow himself with super-human speed.</p><p>The Flash gives Kryad a spare costume, so that Kryad may become the Flash of his century. Kryad returns to his time, to confront the threat of an alien creature that is feeding off the psychic energy of Kryad's people. Kryad attempts to vibrate the creature into the ground, but the alien horror is able to counter Kryad's vibrations with it's own. Having stowed away aboard Kryad's ship, the Flash appears, begging Kryad to change tactics. Kryad, though, is resolute in his actions. Kryad  gyrates his molecule to a lethal frequency, disintegrating himself and the creature. Having glimpsed the scarlet blur of the Flash, racing about at super-human speed, the people of Kryad's time recognize their savior. A statue of the Flash is erected, in memory of the hero who saved their world.</p><h3><ins>Tomorrow Is Forever</ins></h3><p>Kent Nelson discovers the dead body of his wife, Inza, in the ruins of California.

The only thing standing in Malferrazae's way... Doctor Fate. To deal with Doctor Fate, Malferrazae gave form to Inza's jealousy, creating a spiteful horror.</p><p>Doctor Fate was trying to merge Inza with her jealousy, when the creature stole the Helmet of Fate, severing Nabu's connection to Nelson. Malferrazae believes that Inza's death will spur Nelson to shun Nabu, thus ensuring Malferrazae's victory, The opposite proves to be true, when Inza pleads with her husband to continue the fight. Inza's jealousy  blends with Inza's desire for Nelson. The creature throws itself at Nelson, who responds by kissing it passionately.</p><p>The creature is suddenly torn between it's jealousy and desire. In that moment of internal conflict, Nelson strikes, and reclaims the Helmet of Fate. Miles away, in Mexico City, Malferrazae knows that he is undone. Doctor Fate restores Inza to life. Growing to truly epic proportions, Doctor Fate literally straddles the Earth, then casts a spell that reverses all the chaos and damage Malferrazae has wrought. The Lord of Chaos is destroyed.

Wiggins holds a company meeting at the Wiggins Toy Corporation. Wiggins informs the staff that Colonel Computron is either connected to one of the employees, or may, in fact, be an employee. The Flash expresses his unease with Wiggins' reveal. As soon as the Flash departs, Wiggins is abducted by Captain Boomerang, who has forged an alliance with Colonel Computron. The Flash, as police forensic scientist, Barry Allen is accosted by his beautiful neighbor, Fiona Webb. News of Allen's ""date"" with movie star, <a href=""/daphne-dean/4005-35295/"" data-ref-id=""4005-35295"">Daphne Dean</a>, has reached Webb, and she's not happy about it. Allen overhears a radio report about a giant boomerang, and immediately goes to investigate it, as the Flash. Captain Boomerang pops out of a hatch to reveal his presence.</p><p>The Flash charges up the boomerang, leaving himself open to attack from Colonel Computron. The Flash is hit with a tranquilizer dart, as the boomerang begins to violently vibrate. Just as Captain Boomerang is about to escape the boomerang, Colonel Computron betrays him, and knocks him, forcefully, back through the hatch. The boomerang is launched through time, into the distant past, where it lands on an 18th century pirate ship. Realizing that the Flash is his only hope for returning to his proper era, Captain Boomerang protects the Flash's unconscious body, from the pirates. Ultimately, Captain Boomerang is overwhelmed. The pirates hoist the bodies of Captain Boomerang, and the Flash, over the side, and prepare to bleed them to attract sharks.</p><p>Captain Boomerang revives the Flash with a miniature electro-boomerang.  The Flash vibrates their molecules into intangibility, allowing the pirates' gunfire to pass harmlessly through them. After taking out the pirates, the Flash uses his super-human speed to relaunch the boomerang, back to present day. Colonel Computron forces Wiggins to play a video game. Should Wiggins lose, he will be electrocuted. The Flash rescues Wiggins, while Captain Boomerang engages Colonel Computron in combat. Colonel Computron flees. Captain Boomerang also attempts to escape, but the Flash stops him. Dinner at the Nurblin home, finds the three family members conversing, innocuously, over the day's events, all the while suspecting one  another of being Colonel Computron.</p><h3><ins>""Rogue Gods""</ins></h3><p>Doctor Fate has been cast into the ""Nihil-Verse"", a hallucinatory, nightmarish dimension. Doctor Fate shatters his mystic bonds, landing on a strange world, that proves to be almost entirely illusory. It is here that Doctor Fate is attacked by Vandaemeon, a Lord Of Chaos. Inza Nelson has dinner with Vern Copeland, the Curator of the Boston Museum of Natural History. Doctor Fate fights a pitched mystical battle against Vandaemeon. Branding Vandaemeon with the symbol of the Lords of Order buys Doctor Fate time to escape. Vandaemeon though, is not so easily defeated. Doctor Fate never makes it out of Vandaemeon's realm.

Upon arrival, the Flash finds the exchange filled with super-heated steam. The Flash apprehends ""Heat Wave"", only to suddenly collapse. A delayed reaction from exposure to the steam has started a chain reaction. igniting the molecules of the Flash's body.</p><p>To save himself, the Flash uses his total molecular control, over the atoms of his own body, to begin shedding the igniting molecules. Rory, as Heat Wave, confronts Hobart, as ""Heat Wave"". Unbeknownst to Hobart, Rory taped their last hypnosis session, and discovered Hobart's scheme. Both men fire their weapons on one another, a tactic that threatens to kill them both. The Flash uses the last of his igniting molecules to diffurse the incendiary threat, and end the fight between the two Heat Waves. Rory reveals Hobarts' scheme to the Flash, and assures his old foe that the real Heat Wave has reformed.</p><h3><ins>Blood On The Sun</ins></h3><p>Doctor Fate is locked in combat with the Lord Of Chaos, Vandaemeon.

After saving the surrounding police officers from harm, the Flash puts a stop to the conflict. Psykon reveals himself to be William Dawson. Years ago, in an escape attempt from Gorilla City, Grodd ingested a poison capsule, killing his body, but setting his mind free. Grodd used his psychic abilities to possess Dawson's body, forcibly ejecting Dawson's psyche into the void.</p><p>With his force of mind power, Grodd reshaped Dawson's body into Grodd's. Dawson's mind became one with the universe. During Grodd's last gambit, Grodd had cause to revert his body back to Dawson's true form. This momentary transformation rekindled Dawson's interest in his lost humanity. Dawson's psyche returned to Earth to reclaim his body from Grodd. When the Flash intervenes on Grodd's behalf, Psykon mentally compels the Flash to run, faster and faster.</p><p>Psykon and Grodd resume their psychic duel for Dawson's body. On the verge of death from exhaustion, the Flash gambles on accelerating even faster, literally outracing Psykon's psychic compulsion. The Flash returns to the fray, and immediately attacks Psykon. Despite the Flash's best efforts, Psykon is seemingly unbeatable. Psykon's superiority prompts Grodd to swap consciousnesses with Psykon. Grodd's mental powers, however, prove incapable of maintaining Psykon's highly evolved state.</p><p>Psykon's body reverts to that of the homeless man Psykon had initially possessed. Grodd continues to fight back, but Psykon has the upper hand. Psykon regresses Grodd's intellect to that of the homeless man Grodd's mind inhabits. With the last of his psychic power, Psykon returns Grodd's body to that of Dawson. The Flash reveals that he had been working with Psykon all along, to return him to his proper body. Dawson resumes his life as a human being. The amnesiac Grodd begs for change among Central City's homeless population.</p><h3><ins>Crimson Testament</ins></h3><p>The renegade Lord of Order, Ynar, has revealed his alliance with the Lord of Chaos, Vandaemeon. Doctor Fate reflects on the events leading up to this moment. In a desperate attempt to overcome his foes, Doctor Fate merges Inza Nelson's consciousness with his own. The union of Kent and Inza Nelson with the Lord of Order, Nabu, allows Doctor Fate to forge mystic shackles, chaining Ynar and Vandaemeon together forever. With his foes in bondage, Doctor Fate casts them out of the mortal realm. With the removal of the Helmet of Fate, Kent and Inza Nelson are freed from their union within Doctor Fate. Having shared consciousness, both have a deeper understanding of their relationship, and the problems that threaten to tear them apart.</p>",,,,,,,False,22415,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469233-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21p8fim3jvr0bbsh%29jjv%282q~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",313,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55839/', 'id': 55839, 'name': 'Gorilla City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gorilla-city/4020-55839/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/massachusetts/4020-55745/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55851/', 'id': 55851, 'name': 'Tower of Fate', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tower-of-fate/4020-55851/'}]",3-Way Fight for the Super-Simian! / Crimson Testament,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56063/', 'id': 56063, 'name': 'Helmet of Fate', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/helmet-of-fate/4055-56063/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29191/', 'id': 29191, 'name': 'Dennis Jensen', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-jensen/4040-29191/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6536/', 'id': 6536, 'name': 'Keith Giffen', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keith-giffen/4040-6536/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2109/', 'id': 2109, 'name': 'Larry Mahlstedt', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/larry-mahlstedt/4040-2109/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41457/', 'id': 41457, 'name': 'Len Wein', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/len-wein/4040-41457/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41153/', 'id': 41153, 'name': 'Martin Pasko', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/martin-pasko/4040-41153/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14893/', 'id': 14893, 'name': 'Mike Decarlo', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-decarlo/4040-14893/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41455/', 'id': 41455, 'name': 'Mike W.

Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, calls on his beautiful neighbor, Fiona Webb, only to find her getting ready for a date, with Senator Creed Phillips. Webb leaves Allen to lock up. Allen's young neighbor, Troy Nathan, informs him that Allen's presence is required at police headquarters. En route to the police station, Allen, as the Flash, takes time out to  thwart the ""Spoilers"", a local gang that preys on high school students. Unbeknownst to the Flash, the Golden Glider has drawn a bead on him.</p><p>Before she can fire her weapon, it is frozen solid by her brother, the notorious Captain Cold. Captain Cold convinces the Golden Glider that it is too soon to assault the Flash. In the police forensics laboratory, the Flash, as Allen, examines the remains of the Eradicator's victims. The molecular structure of their bodies has been broken down into a soapy solution, resembling bicarbonate of soda. Mick Rory, formerly the notorious criminal Heat Wave, awakes to find it snowing in his room, heralding the arrival of Captain Cold.</p><p>Captain Cold, along with the Golden Glider, assault Rory, chastising him for daring to go straight. Phillips establishes a strong anti-crime platform, to run on for his re-election. Phillips' hardline position against organized crime prompts Mr. Domino to order a hit on Phillips. Umbrage over Phillips' relationship with Webb automatically costs him Allen's vote. Allen joins police captain Darryl Frye, at his home, for dinner. While Frye's wife, Thelma, cleans up the dinner dishes, Frye escorts Allen into his private gym. There, Frye reveals his secret identity, that of masked vigilante, Captain Invincible.</p><p>Captain Invincible demands Allen attack him, to demonstrate his fighting prowess, After deflecting Allen's half hearted attack, Captain Invincible feints. Allen, at super-human speed, removes the Captain Invincible costume from Frye, redressing him in his civilian clothes, before Thelma can reach the bottom of the stairs. Phillips drops Webb off at her apartment. Frye confides in Allen that Allen is the only man who knows Frye's secret. En route home, Allen overhears a police broadcast, regarding the assault on Rory. Allen races to the crime scene, as the Flash.</p><p>The Flash removes the jewels from Rory's person, that were causing him to hallucinate that he was burning. Rory moves to get dressed, springing a death trap Captain Cold rigged in Rory's closet. The Flash saves Rory from certain death. As the Flash, somewhat, obsessively passes by his rival, Phillips' apartment buliding, he spies two men scaling the outer wall. The Flash knocks them loose from the wall, then enters Phillips' apartment to make sure there are no other thugs inside. Only Phillips' butler is on the premises. The Flash rescues the two thugs he sent plummeting to their doom.</p><p>A third assassin, however, is lurking on the roof. This man has the misfortune of encountering the Eradicator. As with all of the Eradicator's victims, the assassin comes to a grisly end.</p>",,,,,,,False,22486,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469244-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",314,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Look Upon The Eradicator!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-60268/', 'id': 60268, 'name': ""Golden Glider's Jewels"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/golden-gliders-jewels/4055-60268/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58440/', 'id': 58440, 'name': ""Heat Wave's Flamethrower"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heat-waves-flamethrower/4055-58440/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29191/', 'id': 29191, 'name': 'Dennis Jensen', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dennis-jensen/4040-29191/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-3493/', 'id': 3493, 'name': 'Frank Giacoia', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-giacoia/4040-3493/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41457/', 'id': 41457, 'name': 'Len Wein', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/len-wein/4040-41457/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-314-look-upon-the-eradicator/4000-22486/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Entering the bank, the Flash discovers a robbery in progress. After taking down the would-be thieves, the Flash resumes his race to the awards ceremony. Phillips presents the Flash with a plaque commemorating the Flash's continued service to Central City.</p><p>Mick Rory, formerly the notorious Heat Wave, is abducted by Goldface's thugs. Rory knows the Flash's secret identity, and Goldface wants it. Rory activates a heat shield, that allows him to escape from Goldface's clutches. The Flash apprehends notorious pick pocket, ""Fingers"" Lonnigan. The Flash interrogates Lonnigan regarding the murder of Central City crime boss, Mugsy Malone. Lonnigan fingers Goldface for the crime. While analyzing the remains of the Eradicator's latest victim, the Flash, as Allen, is called to Police Captain Darryl Frye's office. Allen finds Frye in his Captain Invincible costume. With the Flash no doubt occupied with Goldface, Captain Invincible declares his intent to go after the Eradicator.</p><p>To demonstrate his quick change acumen, Captain Invincible calls Frye's secretary, Madge, into the room. Madge enters to find Frye in his underwear, his quick change skills still, clearly, needing a bit of practice. Phillips is contacted by his doctor, regarding anomalies in a recent chest x-ray. Goldface murders one of his minions for failing to track down Rory. Phillips' doctor is murdered by the Eradicator. Goldface attacks Central City Police Headquarters, to draw out the Flash. The Flash hammers away at Goldface, but his blows prove ineffectual against Goldface's armor. After getting a good grip on the Flash, Goldface haymakers the Scarlet Speedster, knocking the Flash, unconscious, and clear across town. Rory holes up in Allen's apartment.</p>",,,,,,,False,22564,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469251-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",315,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",The Eradicator Strikes Again!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6509/', 'id': 6509, 'name': 'Ernie Colon', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ernie-colon/4040-6509/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42465/', 'id': 42465, 'name': ""Gene D'Angelo"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gene-dangelo/4040-42465/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6536/', 'id': 6536, 'name': 'Keith Giffen', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/keith-giffen/4040-6536/', 'role': 'penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-32168/', 'id': 32168, 'name': 'Rodin Rodriguez', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rodin-rodriguez/4040-32168/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-315-the-eradicator-strikes-again/4000-22564/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The Flash races back to Central City Police Headquarters, to resume his battle with Goldface. The Flash stomps Goldface through several floors, and the street, ending up in the sewers. The Flash is relentless in his attack, never giving Goldface the chance to react. Lulled into a false sense of confidence, the Flash is sucker punched by Goldface, and falls unconscious, as the sewer tunnel collapses upon him. Goldface walks away from the fight in triumph. The Flash eventually makes his way back up to the street, and resumes his civilian identity, that of police forensic scientist, Barry Allen.</p><p>Mick Rory, formerly the notorious Heat Wave, has taken sanctum in Allen's apartment. Senator Creed Phillips discovers that his doctor has been murdered by Central City's newest vigilante, the Eradicator. Police Sargent Jack O'Malley is gunned down by one of Goldface's assassins. Goldface threatens to order further assassinations of police officers, should the Flash appear in Central City again. Mistaken for a prowler, Rory is attacked, and subdued, by Captain Invincible. Allen acknowledges that Rory is, in fact, his houseguest. Captain Invincible asks Allen to relay a message to the Flash, proposing a team-up to take down the Eradicator.</p><p>Phillips begins showing visible signs of stress, frequently manifesting as panic attacks. The Flash plots a stratagem against Goldface with Rory. Heat Wave comes out of retirement to steal the loot from a pair of jewel thieves. Heat Wave's newest Hot Rod backfires, rendering him unconscious, and at the thieves' mercy. Wanted by Goldface, the thieves hand Heat Wave over to Central City's newest crime boss. Fiona Webb calls Allen, never realizing that she is speaking to Rory. Webb is concerned over Phillips' increasingly erratic behavior. The Eradicator shakes down a would-be mugger for information about Goldface.</p><p>Having ascertained Goldface's location, the Eradicator executes the thug. ""Heat Wave"" is revealed to be the Flash, in disguise. With the element of surprise on his side, the Flash attacks Goldface, crashing them both through a window, and down to the lake below. The Flash's assault proves futile. The Flash is barely able to escape from Goldface, and reach the water's surface before he drowns. His respite, though, is merely momentary, as Goldface is quick to drag the Flash back under. The Eradicator appears and disintegrates all of Goldface's minions. Goldface leaves the Flash to drown, tied to an anchor beneath the surface.

The Flash finally pulls the anchor free from the lakebed, and makes it back to the surface. Goldface's armor proves impervious to the Eradicator's attacks.

Senator Creed Phillips' butler, Harold, discovers the Eradicator's costume, laying on Phillips' bed. To protect his secret identity, Phillips disintegrates his butler. Captain Invincible leaps upon the hood of a getaway car. The car abruptly stops, hurling Captain Invincible to the pavement. Before he can strike the ground, Captain Invincible is saved by the Flash. In the time it takes the Flash to disable the getaway car, and turn the crooks over to the authorities, Captain Invincible makes his escape from the crime scene.</p><p>The Flash, as Allen, analyzes a voice recording he made of the Eradicator, in their last encounter. During a television interview, Phillips becomes agitated by the line of questioning, and storms out, dragging Webb behind him. When a security guard tries to intervene, Phillips disintegrates him, publicly revealing himself to be the Eradicator. Upon hearing the news of Webb's abduction, police captain, Darryl Frye, dons his Captain Invincible costume. Allen, also joins the manhunt, as the Flash. Hiding in a cave on the outskirts of Central City, Webb soon comes to the realization that Phillips is suffering from a split personality, and had no knowledge that he, himself, was the Eradicator.</p><p>When a bear threatens the couple, Phillips disintegrates it. The Flash begins his search for Phillips, and Webb, at Phillips' apartment. Unbeknownst to the Flash, Phillips had planted an explosive device, in his apartment, in an attempt to destroy his murderous alter-ego. Said explosive device is triggered, instead, by the Flash. The Flash vibrates his molecules into intangibility, but the blast wave still renders him unconscious, and partially fused with the wall. Captain Invincible discovers the Flash's predicament, and renders aid. Captain Invincible shatters the wall the Flash is trapped in, but overestimates the necessary force, sending them both plummeting to the street, far down below.</p><h3><ins>New Hopes, New Fears.</ins></h3><p>The Creeper intervenes in a mob shake down.

In the time it takes for the Creeper to get the man medical attention, the third thug, Tom ""Thumbs"" Tamblin, has escaped. The Creeper, as former television personality, Jack Ryder, meets up with Wendy Fargo. Ryder and Fargo journey to Boston, where Ryder interviews for a job at Fargo's station. The owner of the station, H.J. Harrigan, takes Ryder on, as a roving investigative reporter.</p><p>Ryder's first assignment is to get the story on Tamblin, who has recently also moved to Boston. Tamblin meets his new employer, Wesley Winterborn III. Tamblin's new boss tasks him with courier work, while also assisting with ""collections"". In Gotham City, Police Commissioner, James Gordon, puts out an all points bulletin for Tamblin's arrest. The Creeper, again, intervenes in a mob shake down. The Creeper is about to break Tamblin's arm, when one of the other gunsels mows the Creeper down, with an automatic weapon.

Captain Invincible frantically slaps the Flash, mid-fall, to rouse him from his unconscious state. With less than a second before impact, the Flash slings Captain Invincible's cape around a flag pole, stopping their descent. The Flash races Captain Invincible to a secluded location, so that they may speak privately. Despite Captain Invincible's demonstration of his ""cardio power"", the Flash asks him to leave the apprehension of the Eradicator to the Flash. In a cave on the outskirts of Central City,Senator Creed Phillips tells Fiona Webb how he became the Eradicator.</p><p>Phillips' tough stance on crime garnered the attention of the underworld, which opted to assassinate Phillips. After abducting Phillips, his body was thrown into a hole, filled with stolen plutonium. Instead of killing Phillips, the plutonium endowed him with horrific power, while also raising a new personality culled from Phillips' subconscious. Creed's subconscious personality became the murderous vigilante, the Eradicator. The Flash continues to scour the city for any trace of Phillips, or his hostage, Fiona Webb. The Eradicator sends a package, for the Flash, to Central City police headquarters.</p><p>Police Captain, Darryl Frye, opens the package, then heads out to confront the Eradicator, as Captain Invincible. An explosion, generated by jewel thieves, imperils the lives of innocent bystanders, from the threat of falling glass. The Flash rescues the civilians, while continuing his search for Phillips. On Oa, the Guardians of the Universe dispatch a Green Lantern to Earth, to deliver urgent news to the Flash. Captain Invincible confronts the Eradicator. Captain Invincible's high intensity energy weapon proves futile against the Eradicator.</p><p>The Flash discovers the opened package, sent to him, by the Eradicator. The Eradicator seemingly disintegrates Captain Invincible. In reality, moving far faster than the naked eye can see, the Flash wrenched Captain Invincible out of the Eradicator's grasp, and also out of his costume. The Flash then filled the empty costume with super-fine dust, to create the illusion that Captain Invincible had been killed by the Eradicator. The effort has left the Flash too weak to immediately engage the Eradicator. Frye agrees to stay out of the coming fight. Green Lantern, Tomar Re, arrives on Earth with the Guardian's message for the Flash.</p><h3><ins>""Turnabout Is Deadly Play!""</ins></h3><p>Thanks to the regenerative effects of Professor Yatz's serum, the Creeper has survived a volley of point blank machine gun fire. After dragging himself out of the Charles River, the Creeper, as television news anchorman, Jack Ryder, returns to work. Ryder makes note of his boss, H.J. Hannigan, having a heated discussion with an elderly doctor. Ryder, as the Creeper, returns $20,000.00 to a Doctor Baker. The Creeper mistakenly believes the money was taken from Baker in return for mob ""protection"". In reality, the money was to be paid <em>to</em> Baker, for signing blank prescriptions. Baker contacts the mob boss, Wesley Winterborn III, to relay the Creeper's involvement.</p><p>Before the  Creeper's investigation can reach Winterborn III, a hit is put out on Baker. The Creeper arrives too late to prevent the assassination attempt on Baker. The doctor, however, survives. The Creeper learns of the doctor's involvement with the mob. For failing to kill Baker, Winterborn III puts out a contract to asssassinate Tom ""Thumbs"" Tamblin. The Creeper prevents Tamblin's execution, then turns Tamblin over to the police.

The Flash, though, reveals himself to really be the Eradicator. In a matter of seconds, the Eradicator disintegrates the Mirror Master's henchmen. The Mirror Master, himself, flees, barely escaping with his life. The Mirror Master turns himself over to the authorities, for protection. Police Captain, Darryl Frye, nursing a broken arm, speaks with police forensic scientist, Barry Allen. In an abandoned windmill, the Eradicator dances with Fiona Webb, his personality shifting between that of Senator Creed Phillips, and his own.</p><p>En route to Earth, the Green Lantern, Tomar Re, is caught in a golden meteor shower. Rendered unconscious on impact, Tomar Re's power ring initiates safety protocols, drawing him gently to Earth. Allen, as the Flash, interrogates the Mirror Master, regarding his encounter with the Eradicator. At the Mirror Master's secret lair, the Flash locates a special ""photo-cell"" mirror, that has recorded an image of the Eradicator. Implausibly, the Flash is able to track the Eradicator's location, by attuning to light wave frequencies recorded in the mirror. The Flash discovers Webb tied to one of the Windmill's blades. With the Flash distracted freeing Webb, the Eradicator manages to get the jump on him.</p><p>Despite the Flash's best super-speed efforts, he is unable to free himself from the grip of the Eradicator. Only the Flash's complete molecular control, of the atoms of his own body, keep him from being instantly disintegrated. Nothing the Flash does manages to release him from the Eradicator's lethal grip. With his very body slowly dissolving beneath the Eradicator's touch, the Flash opts for one last ditch attempt to save his life. The Flash races them to a cemetery, where the Eradicator sees the graves of several of his prior victims. The shock is enough to jolt Phillips' subconscious mind to the surface. Horrified by his actions as the Eradicator, Phillips reverse the molecular breakdown of the Flash's body, instead disintegrating his own. Tomar Re is discovered, unconscious in a field, by a pair of local farmers.</p><h3><ins>I Gave Him Everything He Ever Wanted!</ins></h3><p>Jaime Harrigan is arraigned on charges of passing fraudulent prescriptions. Television news reporter, Jack Ryder, tags along with local police, following a tip provided by Harrigan. While the police officers arrest a pair of teenagers, Ryder, as the Creeper, takes down their dealer. The Creeper, as Ryder, turns the dealer over to the police. Ryder interviews Doctor Hartnell, at a local drug clinic, regarding Harrigan. Hartnell's nephew, Ben, undergoes a horrific metamorphosis, while speaking with Ryder. The creature Ben becomes, claws out Ryder's throat. Harrigan, in prison, also transforms into a similarly vicious monstrosity.

The baby carriage rolls straight for an enormous mirror. At the last second, before impact, Kid Flash grabs the carriage, and vibrates it's molecules, as well as his own, into intangibility. Though Kid Flash, and the baby carriage, pass through harmlessly, the mirror, nonetheless, shatters. The two men holding the mirror were so awestruck at Kid Flash's spectacular rescue, that they accidentally drop the mirror.</p><p>Kid Flash, as Wally West, arrives at the church, where his uncle, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, is to wed Fiona Webb. West finds that Allen has seemingly left Webb at the altar. In reality, Allen, as the Flash, is currently fighting a running  super-speed battle, across the world, with his nemesis, Professor Zoom, the notorious Reverse Flash. The wedding guests begin to fear the worst for Allen. Police Captain Darryl Frye believes it's time for the police to look into the matter.</p><p>West and Ralph Dibny, the world famous Elongated Man, speak with Allen's father, Henry. West is just about to search for Allen, as Kid Flash, when he is stopped by one of the Guardians Of The Universe. The Guardian has vowed to allow the Flash to face his enemy alone, and will brook no interference in their conflict from West, or anyone else. To taunt his foe, Professor Zoom carves a massive effigy of<a href=""/iris-west-allen/4005-9977/"" data-ref-id=""4005-9977""> Iris West Allen</a>, in the side of a mountain.</p><p>The sight of his dead wife, a woman murdered by Professor Zoom, incites a seething rage in the Flash. Racing at super-human speed, Professor Zoom generates sonic booms that trigger a massive rockslide. The Flash burrows underground for cover. Professor Zoom and the Flash continue their epic battle, underground, ranging from the Himalayas to Miami Beach. To distract his foe, Professor Zoom generates a tidal wave, in Florida. Frye issues an all-points-bulletin to find Allen.</p><p>The Flash chases Professor Zoom, onto a rocket, being launched into space from Cape Canaveral. After vibrating the rocket to pieces, the Flash follows Professor Zoom back to Earth. Professor Zoom speed-writes his intention to murder Webb in the sand. Webb finally accepts the fact that Allen is not coming. The Flash races faster than he ever has before, to prevent Professor Zoom from murdering Webb.

Moving faster than the eye can see, the Flash visits Webb. The Flash, as Allen, assures a revived Webb that his desire to marry Webb is true. Webb falls back asleep. Allen, as the Flash, responds to an urgent summons from the police. Webb awakes to find the doctor standing over her. He assures her that no one has been to see her.

En route, they encounter the Weather Wizard, who has been recently apprehended. The Weather Wizard taunts the Flash, on his way to central booking. Curtis coaches Angelo, a young purse snatcher, on how to behave in court. The Weather Wizard bites down on a capsule, hidden in his left bicuspid, unleashing a thunderstorm inside police headquarters.</p><p>While officers attempt to restrain the Weather Wizard,  the Flash races past the melee, to attack a fleeing officer. The officer turns out to be the Weather Wizard, disguised by an illusion. The ""Weather Wizard"" the officers were trying to restrain was really Police Lieutenant Preston. The Flash, escorted to his jail cell, is greeted by a chorus of criminal taunts. Fiona Webb tries, futilely, to convince her doctors that she really was visited by her fiance, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. The doctors believe Webb has suffered an emotional break from reality.</p><p>The Flash, in his jail cell, reflects on his relationship with Webb. Judge Gerkin, on Curtis' recommendation, dismisses the case against Angelo. Gerkin releases the Flash, from jail, on his own recognizance.  With a criminal case pending against him, the Flash decides to symbolically end his civilian identity. The Flash destroys all of his personal belongings. The ruckus brings Allen's neighbors, Mack, and Troy, Nathan to his door. The Nathans bear witness to the ruin inside Allen's apartment, and contact the authorities. District Attorney, Anton Harvey, tells the press that he fully expects the grand jury to indict the Flash.</p><p>An elderly woman is mugged. Angelo is seen running from the scene of the crime. The Flash goes after him. The Flash is momentarily pulled from the chase, when a car, trying to avoid hitting Angelo, goes skidding through a store front. The Flash catches all the flying shards of broken glass, cutting his hands to ribbons. The Flash apprehends Angelo, only to discover that Angelo was actually in pursuit of the real thief.  The police apprehend the thief. The Flash races to the hospital to tend to his hands. Webb, sensing that Allen, her fiance, has finally come to take her home, runs towards the Flash.</p>",,,,,,,False,23501,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469549-%24t2ec16f%2C%21%29kfifi3cr6cbszy3%28l%29i%21~~60_3.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",326,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""Shame In Scarlet!""",[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-6509/', 'id': 6509, 'name': 'Ernie Colon', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ernie-colon/4040-6509/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5318/', 'id': 5318, 'name': 'Gary Martin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gary-martin/4040-5318/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-26507/', 'id': 26507, 'name': 'Phil Hugh Felix', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/phil-hugh-felix/4040-26507/', 'role': 'letterer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-326-shame-in-scarlet/4000-23501/,,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/story_arc/4045-58229/', 'id': 58229, 'name': '""The Flash"" The Trial of the Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-the-trial-of-the-flash/4045-58229/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-65697/', 'id': 65697, 'name': 'Central City Picture News', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-picture-news/4060-65697/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The ""victim"", however, is revealed to be the Super-Gorilla, Grodd. After traumatizing the officers' minds, Grodd, along with his associates, the Vultures, steal the patrol car. Grodd uses his force of mind power to cast an illusion around himself, as well as the car, so as not to attract undue attention. Superman casts the deciding vote, regarding the Flash's continued membership, in the Justice League of America. Superman votes to allow the Flash to stay in the Justice League of America. Famed trial lawyer, N. D. Redik, arrives in Central City, fueling media speculation that he will be representing the Flash, in the Scarlet Speedster's upcoming trial. The Flash rescues attorney, Peter Farley, whose car has careened off a cliffside.</p><p>The Flash was en route to Farley's law offices,  to hire him as his defender. Farley is honored to be representing the Flash in court. The media report on a grass roots fund drive to contribute money to the Flash's defense. One enthusiastic supporter, Angelo Torres, is participating out of gratitude for the Flash, who saved Torres' mother. Torres is approached, and abducted by Dirk, one of the Vultures. Torres is brought before Grodd, who plans to use Torres, in his latest gambit against the Flash. Doctor Henry Allen, and his wife, Nora, visit Fiona Webb, at the hospital. Webb suffered a total emotional breakdown, when the Allen's son, Barry, left her standing at the altar, on their wedding day. Webb seems greatly recovered, until the Allens give her a photograph of their son.</p><p>Webb begins smacking her head with the framed picture, breaking the glass. Orderlies restrain and sedate Webb. Police forensics scientist, Patty Spivot, collects Barry Allen's personal effects, from the workplace. Police Captain, Darryl Frye, decides to personally hold onto Allens' ring, for safekeeping. Farley sets the Flash up with a place to stay, for the duration of the trial. Redik is outraged to hear that the Flash has hired a small town attorney. Torres gives his mother attitude, imaging that he uses the power Grodd bestowed on him, to kill her.

An unscrupulous doctor records Webb's delusional ramblings, to sell to a tabloid. The Flash deals with the doctor. Checking on Webb, leaves the Flash distraught with feelings of guilt. Ms. Torres speaks with Detective Frank Curtis, regarding her runaway son, Angelo. Famous trial lawyer, R. D. Redik,  is interviewed by the press. Redik contends that by selecting a small town attorney, over Redik, the Flash has no chance of being acquitted at trial.

Curtis asks the Flash to also look for Angelo Torres. While searching for Torres, the Flash is drawn to a strand of colored gas, wafting in the air.  The Flash is snared by a psychic trap, laid by the Super-Gorilla, Grodd. The Flash is transported into a nether dimension, with Grodd close behind him. The Flash sees Torres under attack. Rescuing Torres, the Flash races up the energy beam, being emitted by the attacker's craft. A second before the Flash can grab his opponent, the man, along with his ship, explodes. The Flash confers with Torres.</p><p>Grodd sends his henchmen after the Flash.  The second man, clad in a rocket-powered suit of armor, engages the Flash. The two grapple for several moments. Ultimately, the Flash's assailant loses control of his suit, plummeting to his death. The third, and final, man engages the Flash. This man possesses the same super-human speed as the Flash. Just as the Flash's foe is about to triumph over him, Grodd slays his own minion. The Flash finds himself moving slower and slower. During each of his three battles, the Flash's super-speed has been slowly siphoned off by Grodd.

D. Redik, picks up a copy of the National Penetrator. Redik continues to espouse his belief that without Redik representing him, the Flash will lose his trial for manslaughter. The Flash reflects on all the things that are going wrong in his life. High-priced hair stylist, J.J. Munro, is incapacitated by the Pied Piper. Posing as Munro's assistant, the Pied Piper keeps Munro's appointment to cut the Mayor's hair. Police Captain Darryl Frye's wife chastises him for bringing work home. Frye is informed of a hostage situation, and leaves the breakfast table. One of the Flash's costume rings, currently in Frye's possession, is batted off the counter, to the floor, by Frye's cat.</p><p>While cutting the Mayor's hair, the Pied Piper places a micro sonic device around the Mayor's ear, placing him under the Pied Piper's control. The Flash visits his former attorney, Peter Farley, in the hospital. The Flash questions Farley regarding his law partner, Cecile Horton, and her hatred for the Flash. Farley refuses to break his confidence with Horton. Mayor Gene Pinchot tours the Flash Museum, assessing the damage. Dexter Myles, the curator, asks the mayor for funding to restore the museum.  Pinchot decides against it, shocking his city council members. Horton expresses her intent to get the case against the Flash dismissed, by showing the District Attorney, slides of the Flash's numerous rescues.</p><p>The District Attorney is certain the case will not be dismissed. Frye's cat triggers the hidden spring on the Flash costume ring, releasing the compressed costume. The cat drags the costume under the couch, to maul it. Myles receives word that Pinchot has refused to allocate funds to restore the Flash Museum. When word reaches the Flash, he becomes deeply distraught, to the chagrin of his attorney, Horton. The editor of the National Penetrator tells his top reporter to keep the Flash's story on the front page. The Flash rescues a pair of falling window washers. Despite citizen outcry, Pinchot defends his decision to deny the Flash Museum the necessary restoration funds.</p><p>The Flash angrily confronts Pinchot. A police officer flags the Flash down, with an urgent radio message for him. The caller informs the Flash that a bomb had been planted under the desk of anchorman, Rick Trent. The bomb is set to go off, at that very moment. The Flash races across town, to the television news stuidios. With Trent on the air, the Flash rushes in, and hammers the news desk to splinters. When no bomb is found, the Flash realizes that he's been played for a fool, in front of millions, on network television. Unbeknownst to the Flash, the man who has played him for a fool, is his arch-nemesis, the Pied Piper.</p>",,,,,,,False,24358,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469614-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21rcfji-21izubsb1s%287%2C3w~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",334,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-50067/', 'id': 50067, 'name': 'Flash Museum', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-museum/4020-50067/'}]",Flash Freak-Out!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14893/', 'id': 14893, 'name': 'Mike Decarlo', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-decarlo/4040-14893/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-334-flash-freak-out/4000-24358/,,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/story_arc/4045-58229/', 'id': 58229, 'name': '""The Flash"" The Trial of the Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-the-trial-of-the-flash/4045-58229/'}]",[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The Flash was duped into believing that a bomb had been planted in the television studio. The citizens of Central City respond to the Flash's seemingly crazed behavior. Before the Flash can explain his actions, the news feed is cut. The Flash's defense lawyer, Cecile Horton, is none too pleased with the Flash's actions. In contrast, the Pied Piper is quite pleased with how well his psychological assault on the Flash is proceeding. The Pied Piper contacts Mayor Glenn Pinchot. Still under the Pied Piper's sonic control, the Mayor is told what to say in his next televised interview. Two assassins are contracted, in a most unorthodox fashion, to kill Horton.</p><p>The Flash arrives at Horton's mountain retreat, finding her in her sensory deprivation tank. Horton exits the tank completely nude, embarrassing the Flash. Horton takes the Flash to task over his recent public actions. Police captain, Darryl Frye, inquires as to the location of a ring, belonging to missing police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. Frye's wife suspects the cat may have done something with the ring. The Flash saves a young skateboarder from injury. On request, the Flash shows off his super-speed skateboarding style. The Flash is chastised, by a police officer, for setting a bad example for the kids. A reporter, for the National Penetrator, has discovered the location of Horton's retreat. Pinchot goes on television, calling for the removal of the Flash from Central City's streets.</p><p>During the broadcast, Pinchot musters the will to resist the Pied Piper's commands, and storms off the set. The Flash and Dexter Myles, the Curator of the Flash Museum, are watching the broadcast. The Flash decides to angrily confront Pinchot. The Pied Piper orders Pinchot to kill himself. Pinchot flies his private plane into a tree. Before impact, the Flash chops the tree down. Pinchot then puts his plane into a nose dive, aiming straight for a golf course. The Flash manages to leap onto the plane, and pull Pinchot out, before the plane crashes into the fairway. Pinchot begs the Flash for forgiveness. The National Penetrator reporter sets up on Horton's retreat, recording everything said inside.

Neighbors spy a bloody hand protruding from the rock, as well as one clear survivor. Mayor Glenn Pinchot explains to the Flash that his actions, of late, have not been his own. Pinchot has been under someone else's control. The Flash discovers a micro sonic device, behind Pinchot's ear. A clear sign that the Pied Piper is, once again, at large.</p><p>The Flash has police forensics scientist, Patty Spivot, examine the device. Police captain, Darryl Frye, informs the Flash that Horton's retreat has been destroyed. Horton is believed dead. The Flash races to the retreat. The dead woman is revealed to be Gigi Hogan, an employee of the tabloid newspaper, the National Penetrator. Hogan had broken into Horton's retreat to wire it for electronic surveillance. Hogan's co-hort, Winslow, a photographer for the National Penetrator, survived the landslide.</p><p>With new hope for Horton's survival, the Flash digs through the rock, to enter the retreat. The Flash finds Horton, alive, inside her sensory deprivation chamber. Horton's relief at being rescued momentarily overwhelms her great disdain for the Flash. When the Flash recovers Horton's most cherished possession, a watch, she demands he take his hands off of it. The Flash takes a moment to touch base with his parents, Doctor Henry and Nora Allen. The Flash questions Winslow, at the hospital.</p><p>Winslow managed to photograph the assassins, before they triggered the rockslide. After getting Winslow's film developed, the Flash hunts the two assassins down, in a bar on Central City's lower East Side. The Flash brutally interrogates the two men. The Flash finds the tape recorder that provided the assassins with their target. The Flash meets with world-famous trail lawyer, Nicholas D. Redik. The Flash presents Redik with the tape recorder. Though the recorder is largely destroyed, the serial numbers are intact.</p><p>Numbers the Flash was able to track back to the manufacturer, which provided him with the purchaser's name and signature... Redik. The Flash accuses Redik of trying to kill the Flash's defense attorneys, to force the Flash to hire Redik as legal council. A police officer arrives to arrest Redik. Redik pulls a gun, and tries to kill himself. The Flash disarms Redik, only to see Redik leap out the window. The Flash catches Redik, but the strain on Redik's heart proves to be too much. Redik dies in disgrace. The Flash returns home to his parents. Horton visits the gravesite of someone whose death she blames on the Flash.</p>",,,,,,,False,24551,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469616-%24%28kgrhqv%2C%21nufjl3meh6ybsb1sv3gdq~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",336,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}]",Murder On The Rocks,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer, editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2069/', 'id': 2069, 'name': 'Klaus Janson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/klaus-janson/4040-2069/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-26507/', 'id': 26507, 'name': 'Phil Hugh Felix', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/phil-hugh-felix/4040-26507/', 'role': 'letterer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-336-murder-on-the-rocks/4000-24551/,,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/story_arc/4045-58229/', 'id': 58229, 'name': '""The Flash"" The Trial of the Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-the-trial-of-the-flash/4045-58229/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

A powerful,  dissonant sound is heard throughout Central City. The Flash follows the sound back to one of the Pied Piper's pipes. Lured into a trap, the Flash is attacked by the speed demons. The Pied Piper reveals himself. The radiation trails of the speed demons paralyze the Flash. With the Pied Piper playing the Ultima-Pipe, the speed demons draw the Flash high into the sky. The Pied Piper estimates that the Flash has exactly two minutes remaining of life.</p>",,,,,,,False,24656,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/22094-1995-24656-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",337,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-64952/', 'id': 64952, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4020-64952/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-50067/', 'id': 50067, 'name': 'Flash Museum', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-museum/4020-50067/'}]",Beware the Speed-Demons!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58438/', 'id': 58438, 'name': ""Captain Boomerang's Boomerangs"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-boomerangs-boomerangs/4055-58438/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer, editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2069/', 'id': 2069, 'name': 'Klaus Janson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/klaus-janson/4040-2069/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-337-beware-the-speed-demons/4000-24656/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Though unable to move his limbs, the Flash manages to begin spinning, at super-human speed. The Flash angles his body, so that only the speed demons strike the power lines, destroying them. The Flash demolishes the Pied Piper's hidden lair. The Pied Piper suffers a complete nervous breakdown. Instead of prison, the Pied Piper is brought to the Breedmore Mental Hospital, for observation. Media speculation places the blame for the Pied Piper's condition on the Flash. The Mirror Master contacts Captain Boomerang, regarding the Pied Piper situation. Police Captain, Darryl Frye, employs a psychic, Mister Dreed, in the hopes of finding long-missing police forensics scientist, Barry Allen.</p><p>Frye gives Dreed Allen's ring, to ""read"". Dressed as Police Officers, Captain Boomerang and the Mirror Master check in on the Pied Piper. En route to the Pied Piper's room, they are asked to intervene in the conflict between a massive, muscled patient, named Dufus, and the exterminator who tried to kill Dufus' pet mouse. After throwing the exterminator out of his room, Dufus calms down considerably, as a sedative finally takes effect. Captain Boomerang and the Mirror Master offer to spring the Pied Piper from Breedmore. The Pied Piper, though, has suffered a complete psychotic break, leaving him a mere shell of the Rogue he used to be. Certified public accountant, Nathan Newbury, is struck by lightning,while walking through the park, on a beautiful, sunny day.</p><p>Newbury recovers, seemingly none the worse for wear. The Flash's defense attorney, Cecile Horton, works on building her defense for the Flash. Captain Boomerang and the Mirror Master are joined by their fellow Rogues, Captain Cold, the Trickster, and the Weather Wizard. The Rogues plot their revenge against the Flash. The Flash hires a private investigator, Sidney Dithers, to look into why Horton despises the Flash. The Rogues abduct Dufus, from Breedmore. The Mirror Master makes contact with the <a href=""/the-monitor/4005-31018/"" data-ref-id=""4005-31018"">Monitor</a>, to procure armaments for Dufus. The Rogues condition Dufus to hate the Flash. Outfitting him in armor, with a large spiked mace, the Rogues dub Dufus, ""Big Sir"". Horton agrees to conceal her hatred for the Flash, for the duration of his trial.</p>",,,,,,,False,24742,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469677-%24%28kgrhqf%2C%21nufh9gt0cmwbsh-n5tshq~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",338,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Revenge of the Rogues!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58438/', 'id': 58438, 'name': ""Captain Boomerang's Boomerangs"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-boomerangs-boomerangs/4055-58438/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57175/', 'id': 57175, 'name': ""Weather Wizard's Wand"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/weather-wizards-wand/4055-57175/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer, editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2069/', 'id': 2069, 'name': 'Klaus Janson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/klaus-janson/4040-2069/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-338-the-revenge-of-the-rogues/4000-24742/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Janson.</li><li>""<em>Warday!</em>"" written by Cary Bates, penciled by Carmine Infantino, inked by Frank McLaughlin, colored by Carl Gafford and lettered by Ben Oda.</li></ol><p>The Flash's Rogues Gallery have abducted a mentally-handicapped monster of a man, and outfitted him with armor and armaments. The Rogues dub him ""Big Sir"". The Trickster, using the Flash's boots, stolen from the Flash Museum, sets up a false trail, seemingly left by the Flash. Upon waking, Big Sir sees the five Rogues laid out, unconscious, before him. Defense Attorney, Cecile Horton, interviews Doctor Henry and Nora Allen. The Allens recount their perception of the series of events that led up to the Flash killing Professor Zoom, the notorious Reverse Flash.</p><p>At the Breedmore Mental Hospital, the Flash speaks with Hartley Rathaway's doctor. Rathaway, as the Pied Piper, suffered a complete nervous breakdown, during his last confrontation with the Flash. The doctor assures the Flash, that the Scarlet Speedster had nothing to do with Rathaway's condition. Rathaway was, clearly, a ticking time bomb.The Flash inquires about the hospital escapee, Dufus P. Ratchet. Unbeknownst to the Flash, Ratchet was abducted by Captain Cold, and cast in the role of Big Sir, by the Rogues. The Rogues explain the situation to Big Sir.</p><p>The Rogues had been in battle with the Flash, when Big Sir came to their rescue. The Flash got the better of Big Sir, then took down the Rogues. Upon leaving the battlefield, the Flash trampled a small mouse. The death of the tiny rodent enrages Big Sir. After burying the mouse, Big Sir vows to punish the Flash for his callous actions. A psychic, Norris Dreed, using a ring, once worn by long-missing police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, believes he can find Allen. Dreed calls Police Captain, Darryl Frye, to report on his progress.</p><p>The Rogues scour Central City, in search of the Flash. The Weather Wizard keeps Big Sir obscured, by a torrential rainstorm, to maintain the element of surprise. On board the Monitor's satellite, Lyla, and the Monitor, discuss the Rogues' novel usage of the armor, and armaments, provided to them, by the Monitor. Horton, and the District Attorney, begin selecting jurors, for the Flash's upcoming manslaughter trial. The Flash confronts Captain Cold. The Rogues rush to get Big Sir into the fight. To fuel Big Sir's fury, and hatred for the Flash, the Weather Wizard shows Big Sir a photograph.</p><p>The picture shows the Flash ""grave robbing"" the mouse's corpse from Big Sir's burial mound. Just as the Flash punches Captain Cold into unconsciousness, Big Sir arrives on the scene. Big Sir floors the Flash with a spiked energy ball. Unable to vibrate away from the spiked energy balls, the Flash takes refuge behind a wall. Big Sir punches through the wall, knocking the Flash unconscious. The Rogues watch, gleefully, as Big Sir leaps into the air with the Flash's body. Big Sir intends to take the Flash somewhere private, where he can punish the Flash with no interruptions.</p>",,,,,,,False,24841,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11112/111120209/4157101-flash%20%23339.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images,Covers'}",339,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56079/', 'id': 56079, 'name': ""Monitor's Satellite"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/monitors-satellite/4020-56079/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56254/', 'id': 56254, 'name': 'Space', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/space/4020-56254/'}]",Warday!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58438/', 'id': 58438, 'name': ""Captain Boomerang's Boomerangs"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-boomerangs-boomerangs/4055-58438/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58442/', 'id': 58442, 'name': ""Trickster's Gadgets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tricksters-gadgets/4055-58442/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57175/', 'id': 57175, 'name': ""Weather Wizard's Wand"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/weather-wizards-wand/4055-57175/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer, editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2069/', 'id': 2069, 'name': 'Klaus Janson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/klaus-janson/4040-2069/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-339-warday/4000-24841/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57456/', 'id': 57456, 'name': 'Central City Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city-police-department/4060-57456/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Slater, instead, files a new charge against the Flash, Second-Degree Murder. The Mirror Master pulls off a daring daytime robbery. His is one of five, of the Flash's Rogues Gallery, to commit crimes in the last several hours. The Trickster learns of the new charges brought against the Flash, and that the Flash is still alive. Defense Attorney, Cecile Horton, calls Ralph Dibny, the world famous Elongated Man, to the stand. Horton asks Dibny to give his account of the events surrounding Professor Zoom's death.</p><p>Slater counters Dibny's account, by asking Dibny to identity the dye color of a fired bullet. When Dibny cannot, Slater argues that Dibny, as well as all the other eyewitnesses, could not have truly seen what occurred between the Flash and Professor Zoom. At the velocity the two combatants were moving, they would have been, essentially, invisible to the naked eye. Big Sir liberates some dogs from the dogcatcher. The Trickster convenes with his fellow Rogues. Slater calls Fiona Webb to the stand. Through Webb, Slater establishes that the Flash showed no feelings of remorse over killing Professor Zoom.</p><p>Horton redirects, by having Webb acknowledge that, at the time the Flash was consoling Webb, he had no knowledge that Professor Zoom had died. Private Investigator, Sidney Dithers, questions the groundskeeper at a local cemetery, regarding Horton's visits to the gravesite of John ""Jack"" O""Malley. Dithers learns that O'Malley was Horton's father. Big Sir storms the Animal Shelter to liberate more animals. He is greeted by Captain Boomerang and the Trickster, disguised as employees at the shelter. The Weather Wizard ambushes Big Sir, rendering him unconscious with a lightning strike.</p><p>The Trickster brainwashes Big Sir, with his Mesmeratron, into hating the Flash. The first day of the trial does not go well for the Flash. As Horton, and the Flash, exit out of the rear of the courthouse, Big Sir attacks. Caught flat-footed, the Flash takes a brutal blow across the face. Horton urges the Flash to run, to escape from Big Sir. The Scarlet Speedster races away, moving too fast for Big Sir to follow. The Flash collapses, from his injuries, and is discovered by some youths playing catch. One of the boys unmasks the Flash, and is horrified at the pulped visage he finds behind the mask.</p>",,,,,,,False,25121,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3470214-%24%28kgrhqn%2C%21lsfibtu92%21ibsfkdlg8hw~~60_3.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",341,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",Trial and Tribulation,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56708/', 'id': 56708, 'name': 'Cold Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cold-gun/4055-56708/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58436/', 'id': 58436, 'name': 'Mirror Gun', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mirror-gun/4055-58436/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58442/', 'id': 58442, 'name': ""Trickster's Gadgets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tricksters-gadgets/4055-58442/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57175/', 'id': 57175, 'name': ""Weather Wizard's Wand"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/weather-wizards-wand/4055-57175/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer, editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2069/', 'id': 2069, 'name': 'Klaus Janson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/klaus-janson/4040-2069/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-8294/', 'id': 8294, 'name': 'Tatjana Wood', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tatjana-wood/4040-8294/', 'role': 'colorist, cover'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-341-trial-and-tribulation/4000-25121/,,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/story_arc/4045-58229/', 'id': 58229, 'name': '""The Flash"" The Trial of the Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-the-trial-of-the-flash/4045-58229/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

With Kid Flash on the stand, District Attorney, Anton Slater, begins his line of inquiry. The Flash's defense attorney, Cecile Horton, attempts to discredit Kid Flash's expert super-speed testimony, but is overruled. Slater asks Kid Flash if there were any other way for the Flash to stop Professor Zoom, from murdering Fiona Webb, without killing the notorious Reverse Flash. Kid Flash outlines three such scenarios. Horton makes a point that the Flash had no time to think of options, in taking down Professor Zoom. The Flash only had time to react to the crisis, not analyze it. The Flash gives Kid Flash a silent assent, but Kid Flash still feels terrible for  testifying against his mentor.</p><p>The fugitive, from the future, arrives in the 20th Century, specifically in the Central City Police Forensics Laboratory. Police Captain, Darryl Frye, along with another officer, investigate the break in. Horton discusses the Flash's trial with her assistant, Dwayne. The trial is not going well for the Flash. The fugitive, from the future, breaks into the Central City Police Records Room. The Flash visits with his parents, Doctor Henry, and Nora, Allen. Unbeknownst to the Flash, he is being spied on, from afar, by Horton. Frye discovers that all the information, regarding the Flash's Rogues Galley, has been erased from the Central City Police databanks. Slater shows two stills, from Webb's wedding video, revealing the Flash's rage-filled countenance, just before killing Professor Zoom.</p><p>Speaking privately with the Flash, Horton reveals she has a new strategy for winning the case, but opts not to reveal it, just yet, to her client. In court, Horton makes the case that Webb was not just another innocent endangered by Professor Zoom, but the bride-to be, of missing police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. Professor Zoom murdered Allen's first wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, four years prior.  To explain the Flash's desperation in stopping Professor Zoom, Horton suggests that the Flash is Allen. To prove it, Horton unmasks the Flash, in open court.

The face Horton reveals, however, is not that of Barry Allen. A tabloid reporter is quick to photograph the Flash's unmasked face, but the Flash is even quicker in pulling his mask back down. Fiona Webb, Allen's bride-to be, has an emotional collapse, during the unmasking, brought on by the belief that the long-missing Allen was present. Horton's epic blunder threatens to completely derail any chance the Flash has at an acquittal. Horton discuses her mistake with her assistant, Dwayne.</p><p>Horton had spied on the home of Allen's parents, Doctor Henry and Nora. Horton saw Mrs. Allen handing the Flash's costume to a man Horton presumed was Allen. It never occurred to Horton that the Flash might just be a close personal friend of the Allens. The Flash checks on Webb, at the Breedmore Mental Hospital. Despite her relapse at the courthouse, Webb seems to be recovering quickly. If the mere mention of Allen's name is enough to send Webb into another nervous breakdown, Webb's doctor hopes that the long missing Allen never appears again. During rounds, the Breedmore medical staff checks on their most famous patient, Hartley Rathaway, the notorious Pied Piper.</p><p>As part of his therapy, Rathaway has been asked to overhaul the hospital public address system. Rathaway's sonic ""improvements"" to the system, allow him to render the entire hospital staff, as well as all the patients, unconscious. Rathaway dons his costume, then departs the hospital.The Pied Piper's escape is stopped by Professor Zoom. The sight of the, supposedly, dead Reverse Flash shatters the Pied Piper's already fragile mind. The Breedmore medical staff awake to find the Pied Piper back in his cell, laughing hysterically. The Flash has a private conversation with Horton. The Flash reveals that Horton was, in fact, correct. The Flash <em>is</em> Barry Allen.</p><p>After an attack from Big Sir destroyed his face, the Flash ran to Gorilla City, where his injuries were treated, and he was given a new countenance. The Flash decided not to restore his original features, feeling that, for all intents and purposes, regardless of the outcome of the trial, his life as Barry Allen was over. The Flash asks Horton not to reveal his secret identity, regardless of whether or not said knowledge would win his court case. Wishing to spare Webb any further distress, the Flash deems it necessary to allow ""Allen"" to remain absent. A chartered bus, carrying the twelve jurors of the Flash's trial, is knocked into the river.</p><p>Only one juror, Nathan Newbury, doesn't panic. Newbury seems absolutely certain the jurors will not perish. The Flash rescues the jurors, without ever letting on that he was involved in saving them. A purse thief has the misfortune of stealing a woman's bag right in front of Police Captain, Darryl Frye. Captain Frye gives chase, cornering the thief in an alley. As Frye rounds the corner, he finds himself face to face with Professor Zoom. The Reverse Flash has beaten the thief into unconsciousness. Turning the crook over to Frye, Professor Zoom passes along a death threat, for the Flash.</p><h4><strong>Notes:</strong></h4><ul><li>""<em>Guest Meanwhile..</em>"" ""<em>Ben Oda Remembered</em>"" a

The Flash recounts his side of the story, regarding the events surrounding his accidental killing of the Reverse Flash.

The Flash has been found guilty as charged. Police officers carry the Flash out in handcuffs. Lisa Baldwin, a reporter for WCCN News, fails to get a statement from either the Flash's defense attorney, Cecile Horton, or the jury's foreman, Nathan Newbury. To escape Baldwin, and the courthouse crowds, Newbury races off, at super-human speed, until he is moving too fast for the human eye to see. Newbury is revealed to be the presumably deceased Professor Zoom, the notorious Reverse Flash. The stunning verdict weighs heavily upon the Flash's friends and family. Wally West, in particular, wonders if his damning testimony, as Kid Flash, was the deciding factor in the jurors' verdict. Horton, and Police Captain, Darryl Frye, visit the Flash in jail. They find the Scarlet Speedster's spirit to be completely broken.</p><p>Astonishingly, Newbury teleports into the Flash's cell. Newbury convinces the Flash to accompany him. The Flash finds that he implicitly trusts Newbury. Newbury teleports them both back to the courthouse. Miles away, locked in a floating cube, deep within ""Dunce-Cap Peak"", the Flash's Rogues Gallery are confronted by their jailer, Professor Zoom.  Newbury reveals himself to be a time traveler. From the future, he had born witness to the Flash's adventures. The death of Professor Zoom, a half century before the Reverse Flash had even been born, created a cosmic anomaly, that threatened all time and space. An emissary from the future was selected to go back in time, to minimize the damage caused by the anomaly. This emissary took possession of Newbury's body, to ensure that the jury would acquit the Flash, an outcome already well known in the future.</p><p>With the jury deadlocked, Newbury decided to take the jurors back in time, to the exact moment of Professor Zoom's death. Newbury proved the Flash's justification in taking the Reverse Flash's life. En route back to the present, Newbury was attacked by Professor Zoom, and left stranded in the time stream. Impersonating Newbury, Professor Zoom compelled the jury to return with a guilty verdict. Using future technology, Newbury extricated himself from the time stream, then sought out the Flash. The Flash finds it almost impossible to believe that Professor Zoom could still, somehow, be alive. The Rogues also have a hard time accepting Professor Zoom's return. As they debate their situation, Professor Zoom eavesdrops upon them. Laughing uproariously, ""Professor Zoom"" reveals himself to be the 64th century sorcerer, Abra Kadabra.</p>",,,,,,,False,25837,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/23167-1995-25837-1-flash-the.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",349,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""...and the Truth Shall Set Him Free!""",[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer, editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2069/', 'id': 2069, 'name': 'Klaus Janson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/klaus-janson/4040-2069/', 'role': 'inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41487/', 'id': 41487, 'name': 'Tim Harkins', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tim-harkins/4040-41487/', 'role': 'letterer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-349-and-the-truth-shall-set-him-free/4000-25837/,,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/story_arc/4045-58229/', 'id': 58229, 'name': '""The Flash"" The Trial of the Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-the-trial-of-the-flash/4045-58229/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

issues an arrest warrant for the fugitive Flash. The Flash's defense attorney, Cecile Horton, pays a visit to his parents, Doctor Henry and Nora Allen. The Flash's Rogues Gallery, imprisoned by Professor Zoom, are left to perish in a rapidly shrinking glass case. Stripped of all their signature weapons, their fate seems sealed. Fortunately, Professor Zoom missed the Mirror Master's special mirrored contact lenses. The Mirror Master focuses a laser through his lenses, destroying the Rogues' prison. Free at last, the Rogues immediately begin plotting their revenge. The Flash continues his conversation with juror, Nathan Newbury, at the courthouse.</p><p>Professor Zoom attacks, leveling the courthouse with a missile strike. Grabbing Newbury, the Flash vibrates their molecules into intangibility, slipping beneath the Earth to escape the blast. As soon as the Flash, with Newbury, surface, a police officer attempts to arrest the Flash. The Flash flees with Newbury. Onlookers mistakenly blame the Flash, for the destruction of the courthouse. Worse, they also believe that the Flash has abducted Newbury. The Flash realizes  that continuing to smear his public reputation was the real purpose behind Professor Zoom's attack. The Rogues make their way back to Central City. The Flash, with Newbury, visits his parents.</p><p>The Rogues call on famed tailor, Paul Gambi, to outfit them with new costumes. Saying his goodbyes, the Flash, with Newbury, travel to the 25th Century, in pursuit of Professor Zoom. The Rogues raid the Flash Museum, taking out it's curator, Dexter Myles. Combining their scientific acumen, the Rogues manage to work the Flash's Cosmic Treadmill, sending them forward in time, to the 25th Century. The Flash discovers that there are no historical records indicating that Professor Zoom ever came back from the dead. The Flash, with Newbury, continue their investigation at Professor Zoom's laboratory. There they trigger a booby-trap, which almost kills them.</p><p>Though they are able to narrowly escape death, all possible evidence in the laboratory has been destroyed. Fortunately, a witness is found, who saw the man who, previously, broke into Professor Zoom's laboratory. A memory probe of the witness reveals that the resurrected ""Professor Zoom"" has actually been Abra Kadabra all along. The Flash, with Newbury, travel to the 64th Century, in pursuit of Abra Kadabra. The Rogues' investigation, into the ruins of Professor Zoom's laboratory, also put them on the trail of Abra Kadabra. The Flash, and Newbury, are ambushed by Abra Kadabra, and rendered unconscious. Abra Kadabra reveals that his entire plot revolves around a wager. </p><p>To win, Abra Kadabra needs to keep the Flash in the 64th Century, for the next several hours, to irrevocably alter the Flash's fate, and history. While imprisoned by Abra Kadabra, the Flash begins to suspect the truth about Newbury.The Rogues storm Abra Kadabra's stronghold, immediately falling into a trap. Working together, the Mirror Master, and Captain Boomerang, manage to free the Flash, and Newbury. The Flash returns the favor, by freeing the Rogues. The Rogues level their weapons, in unison, blasting through to Abra Kadabra's command center. Abra Kadabra flees, only to be taken down by the Flash.</p><p>Abra Kadabra's assistant, Snurff, pleads with the Flash to remain in the 64th Century a while longer, to no avail. The Flash returns the Rogues to the 20th Century, but allows them to go their own way. With Abra Kadabra's brainwashing of the jurors of the Flash's trial revealed, the Flash is acquitted of all charges. The Flash, though, never returns to the 20th Century. From the 64th Century, the Flash journeys to the 30th Century, to pay a visit to his late wife's parents. There the Flash learns how, upon her death, Iris West Allen's soul was drawn back to the 30th Century, where her family had it placed in a new body. It was West who journeyed back to the 20th Century, taking possession of Newbury's body, to aid the Flash during his trial. At long last, the Flash and West are reunited, to resume their happy lives as husband and wife.</p>",,,,,,,False,25929,"{'icon_url':

One such magician, Abra Kadabra, bemoans the fact that he can't find work. Craving applause, Abra Kadabra practices his tricks, alone in his room, while listening to recorded applause. Learning that scientists have just invented a time machine, Abra Kadabra sees an opportunity to change his life. Using the Hypno-Ray, concealed in the gem-flower of his lapel, Abra Kadabra paralyzes the scientists. Using the time machine, Abra Kadabra journeys to Central City, in the year 1962. The time machine is destroyed upon arrival, leaving Abra Kadabra stranded in the past. Spying a crowd of bystanders, Abra Kadabra begins performing tricks for them.</p><p>Though impressed with his performance, the crowd isn't responding the way Abra Kadabra would prefer. Using his Hypno-Ray, Abra Kadabra forces the crowd to thunderously applaud him. The applause of the small crowd , though, is not enough to suit Abra Kadabra's ego. Renting a concert hall, Abra Kadabra plans to perform for thousands, but his audience is stolen away by the World Series. Scanning the week's upcoming events, Abra Kadabra finds too much competition for his performance. Looking over the Flash's exploits, in the local paper, Abra Kadabra decides that the only way to make headlines is to steal them. Appearing at the unveiling of a statue symbolizing American freedom, Abra Kadabra uses future technology to cause the statue to disappear.</p><p>Abra Kadabra uses his Hypno-Ray to paralyze his ""audience"", to prevent anyone from pursuing him. Among the paralyzed spectators is police forensics scientist, Barry Allen. Unable to move, Allen cannot go into action, as the Flash. Though Abra Kadabra makes all of the headlines in the following days' papers, he is dissatisfied with the ""performance"", due to the lack of applause. Allen correctly guesses where Abra Kadabra will strike next, and goes to confront him, as the Flash. Sure enough, the Flash arrives at the Central City Library, just in time to see Abra Kadabra make a valuable book disappear. Once more, Abra Kadabra employs his Hypno-Ray to force everyone to applaud his actions, including the Flash.</p><p>To prevent the Flash from pursuing him, Abra Kadabra also commands him to stamp his feet in approval. Determining the Flash to be the only real threat to his continued operation in Central City, Abra Kadabra plots to rid the town of the Scarlet Speedster. Renting out a concert hall, Abra Kadabra offers to give a public performance. When the Flash arrives to arrest him, Abra Kadabra uses his future technology to launch the Flash into orbit. To the audience's eyes, the Flash just seems to disappear, leaving behind his costume. Taking the costume as a souvenir, Abra Kadabra exits the concert hall, to the forced thunderous applause of his captive audience. Though helplessly rocketing through space, the scientist in Allen can't help marveling at the star filled void's majesty.</p><p>A small planetoid's gravity draws Allen down. Allen races at super-speed around the planetoid, until he reaches escape velocity. Allen then launches himself back at Earth, arriving safely in Central City. Attuning his vibrational frequency to the same radiation wavelength Abra Kadabra used to hurl him into space, Allen follows the residual radiation, still clinging to his costume, to Abra Kadabra's location. Vibrating through the wall and into his costume, Allen attacks Abra Kadabra, as the Flash. Abra Kadabra activates the paralyzing power of his Hypno-Ray. The Flash is moving so fast that not only is he able to easily dodge the beam, but he also grabs Abra Kadabra and pushes him into the beam, paralyzing him. Stiff as a board, Abra Kadabra is carried off to jail.</p><h3><ins>The Origin Of Flash's Masked Identity!</ins></h3><p>Having recently gained his fantastic super-speed powers, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, considers going sans mask, as the Flash. Addressing the National Science Convention, Allen reveals that he <em>is</em> the Flash. Allen is just about to demonstrate his powers, when he is alerted to a tornado, on the outskirts of Central City. Moving at super-speed, Allen, as the Flash, generates a counter-rotation, which dissipates the tornado. Arriving at work the next day, Allen is mobbed by a crowd of admirers. No sooner has Allen finally made into his laboratory, at police headquarters, then he is alerted to a burglary in progress.</p><p>Allen races into action, as the Flash. Exiting police headquarters, the Flash finds that the crowd outside has tripled in size. Losing precious seconds navigating the crowd, the Flash arrives at the scene of the crime, too late to prevent the theft. Having spied a car departing the museum as he arrived, the Flash takes a chance and pursues it. Sure enough, it's the getaway car. The Flash generates a mound of compressed air beneath the car, and carries it, and the thieves, to the nearest police station. Allen awakes from his daydream. Realizing that revealing his identity would create unnecessary obstacles in his crime-fighting career as the Flash, Allen decides to add the mask to his costume.</p>",,,,,,,False,131580,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4306436-128.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",128,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56254/', 'id': 56254, 'name': 'Space', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/space/4020-56254/'}]",The Case of the Real-Gone Flash,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58439/', 'id': 58439, 'name': ""Abra Kadabra's Wand"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/abra-kadabras-wand/4055-58439/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-128-the-case-of-the-real-gone-flash/4000-131580/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

While skin-diving, Dibny receives a paralyzing shock. With Dibny long overdue to return, Sue wires police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, asking for aid. Allen responds, as the Flash. While skin-diving at Dibny's last known location, the Flash spies a pair of aquatic beings, traveling on skis. Before he can pursue them, he, too, receives a paralytic shock.

On invitation, the Flash spends the next couple of days in the company of the Dibnys.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Note:</strong> this is the first appearance of Sue Dibny</p>",,,,,,,False,134356,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4285775-119.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",119,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-57530/', 'id': 57530, 'name': 'Central America', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-america/4020-57530/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Mirror-Master's Magic Bullet!; The Elongated Man's Undersea Trap!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55822/', 'id': 55822, 'name': 'Gingold', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gingold/4055-55822/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-119-the-mirror-master-s-magic-bullet-the/4000-134356/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

The culprit is the Pied Piper. On the day prior to the robbery, the Pied Piper had spied Ralph Dibny, the famed Elongated Man, in a crowd of onlookers. The Pied Piper played a special tonal wavelength on his pipe, just for Dibny's ears. On the night of the robbery, Dibny, as the Elongated Man, used his amazing stretching abilities to steal the jewels. After turning the jewels over to the Pied Piper, the Elongated Man returned home, with no memory of his criminal activities.</p><p>The phenomenal nature of the crime attracts Dibny's interest, as a mystery solving sleuth. Though indulgent of his crime solving passions, Dibny's wife, Sue, reminds him that they have a dinner engagement. Arriving late is <em>not</em> an option. At the same time, reporter Iris West is telling <em>her</em> boyfriend, police forensics scientist, Barry Allen, that he, too, had best be on time for their dinner with the Dibnys. Allen consents, though still decides to investigate the tower robbery, as the Flash. Investigating the scene of the crime, the Flash discovers a boot print, on each side of the moat, nearly 30 yards apart.</p><p>Immediately, suspicion falls on the Elongated Man. Before the Flash can act on his fears, he, too, falls under the sway of the Pied Piper. Racing into town, the Flash robs the Bank of Tower City, moving so fast as to be invisible to the naked eye. After turning the loot over to the Pied Piper, the Flash returns to the stone tower, with no memory of his criminal act. Learning of the bank robbery, the Flash arrives on the scene, to find the Elongated Man already investigating the crime. The Flash accuses the Elongated Man of the tower robbery. In turn, the Elongated Man accuses the Flash of bank robbery.</p><p>As evidence, the Elongated Man points out that all the clocks in the bank have stopped, mere milliseconds apart. An effect that could only be achieved by the Flash running past them, at such extreme velocity, that the clock's inner mechanisms would have shattered. Realizing that they're both the dupes of an unknown criminal mastermind, the Flash and the Elongated Man team up to solve the case. The Elongated Man coats the bottom of their boots with a chemical that can only be seen with infra-red light. As a precaution, the Flash imbibes the Elongated Man's stretching elixir, Gingold.</p><p>Suddenly, both men become aware that they've lost time. Using the infra-red light, the Elongated Man follows the trail of their footsteps to the Pied Piper's lair. They find the Pied Piper, ready and waiting for them. Playing on twin pipes, the Pied Piper cause the Elongated Man to twist and stretch out of control. At the same time, the Flash finds himself running in place so fast that he, literally, begins running on air. The Gingold in Flash's system allows him to stretch as the Elongated Man does. Thus, with an elongated arm, the Flash breaks the Pied Piper's twin pipes.</p><p>The Pied Piper races back into his hideout to rearm himself. This gives the Flash time to save the Elongated Man. Racing in tight circles around the Elongated Man, the Flash unwinds the Stretchable Sleuth, while also drawing him back down to earth. The tornado created by the Flash's movements destroys the Pied Piper's lair. The Elongated Man pulls the Pied Piper from the rubble, while the Flash dissipates the tornado, before it reaches the city. The Flash takes the Pied Piper to jail, then returns all the stolen loot. The Elongated Man, as Dibny, just makes it back in time for his dinner date. The Flash, as Allen, arrives 10 minutes late, receiving a scolding from West.</p><h3><ins>Mystery of the Matinee Idol!</ins></h3><p>Kid Flash is the star attraction at Blue Valley's Summer Festival. Suddenly, an elderly man collapses in front of Kid Flash's float. The Fastest Boy Alive drags the man out from in front of the float, then carries him to a hospital. The man is identified as Dexter Myles, a once famous actor. His collapse was apparently brought about by extreme hunger. Learning that his parents are ardent admirers of Myles, Kid Flash decides to get to know the actor. Upon departing the hospital, Myles reveals the sad affair his life has become. His acting style is considered old hat, and many modern theater companies have never even heard of him.</p><p>Recently, though, he had been hired to declaim Shakespeare, in the town square. An act Kid Flash knows to be illegal. Moving faster than the eye can see, KId Flash follows Myles. The old actor meets with his benefactors. Kid Flash doesn't recognize either man as a Blue Valley resident. Suspicious, Kid Flash decides to follow the two men. Myles begins reciting a monologue from Hamlet, at the town square. Soon enough, he draws a large crowd, as well as two officers, there to arrest him. With only the sheriff left in the police house, the two men enter, and demand the sheriff release his prisoner. The sheriff goes for his gun, as the two men fire upon him.</p><p>Kid Flash intervenes, moving the sheriff out of harm's way, while generating a shield of compressed air to block the gunfire. Kid Flash continues waving his arm at super-human velocity, drawing the air away from the gunmen. Weakened by lack of oxygen, they fall easily to Kid Flash's super-speed punches. The sheriff reveals that the two men are part of a notorious gang of bank robbers. Dolman, their safecracker, had been picked up by Blue Valley police. Without Dolman, they had no way of breaking into bank vaults, and thus came to claim him. The publicity garnered by Myles role in the crime lands him a starring role, at Blue Valley's Summer Playhouse. Myles is also given a special permit allowing him to, legally, perform in the town square.</p><h4><strong>Notes:</strong></h4><ul><li>This comic book appeared in the movie <em>Catch Me if You Can</em>.</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,144006,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/67663/4377160-138.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",138,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56286/', 'id': 56286, 'name': 'Blue Valley', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-valley/4020-56286/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Pied Piper's Double Doom!; Mystery of the Matinée Idol!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55822/', 'id': 55822, 'name': 'Gingold', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gingold/4055-55822/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58437/', 'id': 58437, 'name': ""Pied Piper's Flute"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/pied-pipers-flute/4055-58437/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41171/', 'id': 41171, 'name': 'Gardner Fox', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gardner-fox/4040-41171/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31475/', 'id': 31475, 'name': 'Joe Giella', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/joe-giella/4040-31475/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-31303/', 'id': 31303, 'name': 'Julius Schwartz', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julius-schwartz/4040-31303/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21275/', 'id': 21275, 'name': 'Murphy Anderson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/murphy-anderson/4040-21275/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-138-the-pied-pipers-double-doom-mystery-/4000-144006/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-41466/', 'id': 41466, 'name': 'Rogues', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rogues/4060-41466/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

By chance, the murderer is struck down, by a hit-and-run driver. As he lies dying in the street, the murderer confesses to the crime. Allen's crime-solving brilliance is lauded by the local media. Allen's wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, is somewhat surprised at Allen's sudden penchant for egotism. Unbeknownst to Allen, he has been exposed to a mutagenic radiation, by his arch-nemesis, the Trickster. Much to the Trickster's chagrin, the Flash has been keeping a low profile of late, while Allen hogs the spotlight from his costumed alter-ego.</p><p>The Trickster is desperate to be on hand when his radiation treatment slays the Flash. En route to a charity appearance at Central City's Grand Prix, Allen, as the Flash, takes time out to apprehend some jewel thieves. During his takedown of the crooks, the Flash begins experiencing terrible headaches. With the thieves unconscious, the Flash turns to face the crowd, only to see them recoil in horror from him. It is at that moment that the Flash notices that his cranium has expanded to freakish proportions. The Flash contacts his wife to explain the situation to her, then holes up in a laboratory, desperately seeking a cure for his condition.</p><p>His headaches become so great that the Flash bolts from the laboratory, to try to clear his head. When the Trickster finds the Flash, he immediately hits him with sneezing powder. Racing in tight circles on the surface of a lake, the Flash generates a waterspout, that brings the Trickster down to Earth. The Trickster retaliates with explosive peas. As the Trickster once more ascends to the sky, the Flash spins his arms about, like helicopter blades, and pursues his old foe. Ultimately, the Trickster gets the better of his nemesis, and carries his unconscious foe to his secret lair.</p><p>The Trickster takes credit for the Flash's horrifically swollen skull. Blowing up a ""Flash"" balloon, the Trickster demonstrates what will soon happen to the Flash, as his cranium continues to swell. The Flash, though, notices that, ever since the Trickster brought him to his lair, his headaches have stopped. The Flash lunges at the Trickster. A telescoping fist rams forth from the Trickster's chest, pinning the Flash against the wall. Jets of scalding hot water open up on the Flash's head. Vibrating at super-human speed, the Flash passes through the fist, then begins pelting the Trickster with dishes.</p><p>After bashing the Trickster with a recliner, the Flash pummels his foe into unconsciousness. The Flash realizes that residual radiation from the mutagen's antidote lingered on the mynah bird that the Trickster had experimented on. This residue was alleviating the Flash's headaches. Reverse engineering the antidote from the mynah bird, the Flash is able to restore his cranium to it's normal proportions.

Allen, as the Flash, fights back, only to be forcibly ejected from the building. By the time he recovers, the creature is gone. At home, the Flash, as Allen, is sitting down to dinner with his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris, West, when the creature attacks again. Allen and West seek sanctuary in a nearby fallout shelter. Allen is about to engage the creature, as the Flash, when it, once again, disappears. Allen, as the Flash, pays a visit to the Flash Museum, only to find it being robbed.</p><p>The Flash is seconds away from subduing the thieves, when the creature attacks again. The Flash gets the thieves to safety, then turns to face the creature. After one punch, the creature fades away. Suddenly, an alien being appears before the Flash. The alien identifies the creature as a ""Nok"". The alien was transporting the Nok, along with other alien wildlife, to it's home world, when a malfunction in it's spacecraft forced it to land on Earth. The alien has managed to recapture the Nok three times, but each time the Nok has escaped again.</p><p>The alien gives the Flash 6 hours to subdue the Nok, at which time the repairs to the alien's craft will be complete, and it will be departing. The Flash turns the thieves over to the proper authorities. Suddenly, the Flash begins speeding up uncontrollably. The Nok rams the Flash from behind. The force of the impact, coupled with the Flash's extreme velocity, is enough to hurl the Flash across the dimensional void, to a parallel Earth. The Flash awakens on the floor of a warehouse, in the town of Willowdale. His costumed appearance immediately draws attention, and soon a crowd has formed around him.</p><p>The Flash is baffled by the crowd's reaction to him, until a young boy presents him with a Flash comic book. The Flash is amazed that the comic chronicles a prior adventure, down to the most minute detail. The Flash realizes that he is on a parallel Earth, one where he exists only as a fictional character in a comic book. The Flash determines that the power of a Cosmic Treadmill might just be enough to get him back to his own Earth. With only a few dollars in his pocket for supplies, the Flash heads to New York City, to speak with the editor of the Flash comic book, Julius Schwartz.</p><p>The Flash, as Allen, meets with Schwartz, who dismisses his wild claims. At super-speed, Allen puts on his Flash costume, right before the editor's eyes. Convinced, Schwartz heads out to garner the materials the Flash needs to build the Cosmic Treadmill. The Flash assembles the Cosmic Treadmill in Schwartz's office, then uses it to return to his own Earth. Almost immediately upon arriving, the Flash is attacked by the Nok. Vibrating out of it's grasp, the Flash determines that the Nok has been feeding on the invisible aura that protects his body from the heat of friction.</p><p>The Flash races to his laboratory, and builds a weapon that projects the same aura radiation that surrounds his body. Firing on the Nok subdues the creature, as it basks in the radiation. The alien arrives to take possession of the Nok. The Flash hands over the aura-radiation gun, so that the alien can continue to pacify the Nok, on the return journey home. At home, the Flash, as Allen, ponders the notion of being a fictional character on another Earth.

At Baron Katana's command, Daisho hurls the one Samuroid corpse into the sea. Police forensic scientist, Barry Allen, and his wife, Picture News reporter, Iris West, arrive in Tokyo. Allen and West are greeted by Captain Hashi, a colleague of Allen's. Two men commandeer a fighter jet, on the airfield, and fire it's rockets at Allen, West , and Hashi. Allen, as the Flash, intercepts the rockets, moving so fast as to be invisible to the naked eye. The Flash neutralizes the invisible aura that protects him from the heat of friction, causing him to burst into flames.</p><p>The heat seeking rockets change course, locking on to the Flash's greater heat signature. The Flash leads the rockets back to the fighter jet, which is destroyed on impact. The Flash, as Allen, returns to West and Hashi, with neither even aware that he ever left their side. While Allen confers with Hashi about Baron Katana, Hashi's assistant, Tushi, shows West around the crime laboratory. Daisho raises concerns about shrimpers trolling the waters near Baron Katana's family stronghold, the Black Heron. The shrimpers haul up the dead Samuroid in their nets. Hashi is informed of the discovery.</p><p>West pulls Allen away from the investigation, insisting on a night on the town. After attending a sumo wrestling match, Allen takes West to meet his old college friend, Hideki Toshiro. Now a famed director in Japan, Toshiro is working on his latest Samurai picture. Toshiro is interested in doing some location shooting at the Black Heron, but has been unable to garner permission from the property's owner. A small police outpost, in Hokkaido, is attacked by a flying horde of Samuroids. The compliment of officers stationed there are slaughtered. Hashi is informed of the attack, believing it to be connected to the dead Samuroid found by the shrimpers.</p><p>Allen, West and Toshiro rendezvous back with Hashi. A cursory examination of the Samuroid reveals that it is not human at all, but rather a humanoid machine. It's armor is also completely impervious to gunfire. Toshiro points out the crest of the Black Heron on the armor, linking the Samuroid to the House of Kayido, and Baron Katana. Having heard enough, Allen decides to investigate on his own, as the Flash. Racing up the coastline, the Flash quickly reaches the Black Heron. His approach is picked up by Daisho. Determining the Flash's point of entry into his fortress, Baron Katana prepares a warm welcome for the Scarlet Speedster.</p><p>As the Flash prowls through the corridors of the Black Heron, he suddenly finds himself surrounded by a horde of Samuroids. Barely escaping the horde, the Flash finds himself confronted by Daisho. The two men engage in a fierce battle. Ultimately, Daisho is revealed to be a Samuroid himself, meaning he is all but impervious to harm. Baron Katana reveals himself to the Flash, as Daisho closes in for the kill. Hashi learns that Baron Katana is the landowner of the Black Heron, and prepares to head out to arrest him. When Hashi inquires as to Allen's whereabouts, West covers for him, placing her in a particularly tight spot.</p><p>West knows that Allen is already at the Black Heron, as the Flash. West fears his long absence means that the Flash is in trouble. Hashi, though, won't head to the Black Heron, and the Flash's rescue, without Allen.

In Tokyo, Picture News reporter, Iris West, looks for a way to cover her husband's absence, without revealing his secret identity to police captain Hashi, his assistant, Tushi, or filmmaker Hideki Toshira. Hashi is planning to approach Baron Katana's island fortress, known as ""The Black Heron"", under the guise of a film crew. Hashi gathers his elite Black Beret forces, and makes plans to assault the Black Heron. The Flash makes a run for it.

The Flash is stung up over the cliffside of the Black Heron. The ropes binding him are attached to buckets, floating on the sea. As the tide rises, the buckets fill with water, hyper-extending the Flash arms. Baron Katana issues attack orders to his Samuroids. At the same time, Hashi is issuing attack orders to his Black Berets. West presents her ""husband"" to Hashi. Concealed under a wide-brimmed hat and wearing a trench coat, West's ""husband"" feigns laryngitis, so as not to speak in front of Hashi. Toshira outfits the Black Berets in samurai armor.</p><p>Despite the agony of his torture, the Flash refuses to divulge any information to Baron Katana. Hashi's forces land on the Black Heron, and move about the perimeter, acting, for all to see, as a film crew shooting on location. Fearing discovery before he can launch his surprise attack on Japan, Baron Katana has the Flash brought into the fortress, and caged in a cell. Breaking away from Hashi's forces, West begins scaling the cliffside of the Black Heron, intent on rescuing the Flash. West's ""husband"" goes after her. With West breaking the illusion of their strategy, Hashi orders his forces to immediately assault the Black Heron.</p><p>West and her ""husband"", really Tushi in disguise, are taken prisoner by the Samuroids. West's screams spur the Flash to action. The Flash breaks free, and after destroying the Samuroid guard, takes possession of it's sword. Upon scaling the cliffside, Hashi's forces are met by the Samuroids. The Black Berets open up with flamethrowers, but the Samuroids are unaffected. The Samuroids repel Hashi's forces, leaving them dangling down the cliffside by their ropes. The Flash storms Baron Katana's control center, but stops short when he realizes West and Tushi are being held hostage. Daisho gives the order for the Samuroids to slay Hashi's forces.</p><p>Moving faster than the speed of light, the Flash races out of the control room. Rushing past the Samuroids creates a vacuum that extinguishes their jet packs, causing them to fall into the sea. The Flash returns to the exact spot he was standing, with no one the wiser that he ever moved. Tushi suddenly kicks Baron Katana, giving the Flash the opening that he needs. The Flash kicks Daisho into the control panel, shorting out all of the Samuroids. Baron Katana leaps to his death, rather than face imprisonment. West gets the Flash into the clothes her ""husband' was supposedly wearing, before they rendezvous with Hashi. Tushi appears wearing Toshira's armor, claiming that she, surreptitiously, came along on the assault.

Overhearing a police bulletin regarding magicians turned thieves in Central City, Allen investigates, as the Flash. The Flash first encounters master illusionist, Gurston, looting the Market Street Bank. Momentarily slowed down by one of Gurston's illusions, the Flash is able to turn the tables on Gurston, and apprehend him. The Flash then encounters the great cafe magician, Mardonus, who has just robbed a jewelry store. After defeating Mardonus, the Flash rounds up the rest of the magicians in the city, and turns them over to the proper authorities.</p><p>Mardonus allows the police to inject him with truth serum. Mardonus revels that the magicians were at the convention, watching a performance by Heathstone, a specialist in disappearing acts. Heathstone's performance was interrupted by the 64th century criminal magician, Abra Kadabra. When the Magician's Guild refuses to allow Abra Kadabra to join their ranks, due to his criminal past, Abra Kadabra mesmerizes them all, and sends them out to commit crimes. Posing as a reporter, Abra Kadabra gets near enough to the Flash to place the Scarlet Speedster under his spell.</p><p>Amplifying his mesmerism skills with a spellbinding transmitter, Abra Kadabra places the populace of Central City under his control. By his command, every single Central City citizen empties their bank accounts, then showers Abra Kadabra with their money, at a parade in his honor. Abra Kadabra commands the Flash to collect all the falling cash. Abra Kadabra bids the Flash to come to his side, where Abra Kadabra treats the Scarlet Speedster as a dog. The burning humiliation of his debasement shakes the Flash from Abra Kadabra's control. The Flash attacks Abra Kadabra, and after a brief battle, defeats him. Using his Cosmic Treadmill, the Flash returns Abra Kadabra to the 64th century, and prison.</p><h3><ins>The Flash's Super-Speed Phobia!</ins></h3><p>The Flash scours Central City's streets for Sneakers Sneed, and his gang of hoodlums. Though the Flash speeds up to vibrate through a wall in his path, the Scarlet Speedster actually slams into it. Once recovered from the impact, the Flash finds that he is terrified to travel at super-human speed. The Flash tries to overcome his fear, to no avail. Stumbling upon Sneed in the commission of a crime, the Flash, even without the use of his powers, attempts to apprehend him. After a brief tussle, Sneed, and his gang flee.</p><p>The Flash is forced to hail a taxi to continue his pursuit. Catching up to Sneed, in his hidden lair, the Flash is quick to attack. Without using his powers, the Flash defeats Sneed, and his entire gang. Seeking medical assistance, the Flash learns that the blow he suffered, from crashing into the wall, has upset his inner ear, throwing off his balance, and causing the dizziness he feels whenever he tries to run. With a little rest, and the proper medical care, the Flash is soon racing through the city again.</p><h3> </h3>",,,,,,,False,144012,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26751/629236-182.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",182,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Thief Who Stole All the Money in Central City,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56362/', 'id': 56362, 'name': 'Flash Costume Ring', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/flash-costume-ring/4055-56362/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48152/', 'id': 48152, 'name': 'John Broome', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-broome/4040-48152/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9070/', 'id': 9070, 'name': 'Mike Esposito', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-esposito/4040-9070/', 'role': 'artist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'artist'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-182-the-thief-who-stole-all-the-money-in/4000-144012/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Allen is being tailed by Tips, a criminal in the employ of the Frog. Onboard the coach, Allen ""accidentally"" reveals his Flash costume, when his suitcase briefly pops open. In Central City, Tips reports to the Frog that the man he has been following all week might be Allen, or he might just be an unemployed actor. Allen gets into his car, and comes face-to-face with himself. The crooks tail Allen to the police symposium, where the Flash will be giving a lecture. Tips follows the Flash into the symposium, while the Frog continues following Allen's car.</p><p>The Frog sends his henchmen, Li'l Moe and Slice, into a parking garage to collect Allen. The two thugs just miss getting their hands on Allen, who escapes them in the elevator. When the elevator returns to the parking garage, the crooks find a lifelike rubber mask, of Barry Allen's face, on the elevator floor. Picture News reporter, Iris West, joins the Flash at the police symposium. With whispered words, she reveals that she was the ""Barry Allen"", who picked up Allen at the bus terminal. Somehow, the Frog has learned that Barry Allen is the Flash, thus a ruse has been played out to sow doubt in the crooks' minds. An assassin, disguised as a waiter, shoots the Flash.</p><p>The second the Flash hears the explosion of the expanding gases in the gun barrel, he begins vibrating at super-speed, so that the bullet passes harmlessly through him. Tips guns down the assassin, then identifies himself as a Borderville detective. Suspicious, the Flash tails Tips. Giving himself away in the stairwell, the Flash finds himself being fired upon by Tips. The Flash tackles Tips, landing in the hotel kitchen. Tips pies the Flash, blinding him, then covers the floor in pies. The Flash skids across the kitchen floor. Tips pours scalding hot coffee on the Flash's face, then sprays him down with a hose from the sink.</p><p>Tips produces an instant-icer, and freezes the Flash solid, in a block of ice. Tips informs the Frog that he has taken care of the Flash. Tips demonstrates the instant-icer by flash-freezing a doorman. With their sole obstacle out of the way, the Frog embarks on his latest criminal enterprise. Li'l Moe, and Slice, beat down a cargo handler, and a security guard, at a local airfield, and take their places. As a shipment of rare palladium arrives, the crooks steal it, and load it into their own plane. Using his complete molecular mastery over his own body, the Flash is able to break free from his icy encasement. By vibrating at the same frequency as the instant-icer, the Flash is able to track the crooks down at the airfield.</p><p>Tips tries to freeze the Flash again, only to see the Flash turn the instant-icer against him. With the Flash vibrating into intangibility to avoid their gunfire, L'il Moe suddenly releases all of his ammo onto the ground. The Flash slips on the rolling bullets, giving the crooks the opportunity to run the Flash over, with their plane. At the last second, the Flash rolls out of the way. Leaping onto the plane, the Flash manipulates the plane's rudder, causing it to crash. After defeating the Frog, L'il Moe, and Slice, the Flash returns to the police symposium to deliver his speech.</p>",,,,,,,False,144013,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26751/629238-183.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",183,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Flash's Dead Ringer!,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-34476/', 'id': 34476, 'name': 'Frank Robbins', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-robbins/4040-34476/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9070/', 'id': 9070, 'name': 'Mike Esposito', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-esposito/4040-9070/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'artist'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-183-the-flash-s-dead-ringer/4000-144013/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

Vista, near <a href=""/central-city/4020-54995/"" data-ref-id=""4020-54995"">Central City</a>, astronomers discover that two massive pulsars have converged, and are on a collision course with Earth. <a href=""/iris-west-allen/4005-9977/"" data-ref-id=""4005-9977"">Iris Allen</a> arrives to interview the the scientists just in time for them to discover that Central City is at ground zero for the impact. As the scientists panic, Iris rushes outside to contact <a href=""/barry-allen/4005-22804/"" data-ref-id=""4005-22804"">Barry Allen</a>, hoping that the Flash can save the city.</p><p>Barry rushes away from work, and as the Flash, creates an ionic updraft that seems to shield Central City from the impact, diverting the combined pulsars back into space. However, the exertion causes him to pass out. When he comes to, he finds a giant crater where Central City used to be. It appears that Flash has destroyed his city in attempting to save it.</p><p>While mourning the loss of Iris and the other residents of Central City, Flash ""hears"" a distress call coming from the crater, though it seems to exist only in his mind. He follows the signal and discovers what looks like a slightly larger-than-human mud creature. The creature attacks, and as Flash thinks about his strategy, he discovers that it is also reading his mind. By spinning into the ground at super-speed, Flash creates a quicksand pit to trap the creature. At that point, he discovers that the creature is actually just a mud-covered (but abnormally tall) human woman wearing a space suit.</p><p>The woman tells Flash her story. Her name is Zoral, and she comes from the year 4005. After some discussion, Flash and Zoral decide that Flash's super-speed rescue of Central City must have caused her and the city to switch times and places. Just then, Zoral's vibrational frequency starts to return to normal, which will cause her to return to her own time. Flash grabs her just in time, and is transported to 4005 along with her.</p><p>As the pair travels through time, Zoral explains to Flash that in her time, people's emotions are controlled by ""anti-violence emitters"" that prevent them from killing or even feeling strong emotions. Further, Zoral's boss Dr. Yom is working on a device called the quantum-time-shift-resolver, which will allow him to bring entire cities from the past into the future to serve as living museum exhibits. She suspects that he will take the appearance of Central City as proof that the device works.</p><p>When Flash and Zoral finally arrive in the future, they are immediately attacked by a patrol armed with anti-violence ray guns. As Flash struggles against one of the patrolmen, Zoral attempts to use her own pacifying gun to help Flash, but accidentally shoots him instead. The two of them are then taken prisoner, and brought before Dr. Yom. As they are being led in, Flash catches sight of Iris on a view screen broadcasting video from Central City, and the surge of emotion he feels overrides the effects of Zoral's anti-violence gun. He continues to act as if he has been pacified, though.</p><p>Just as Zoral suspected, Dr. Yom believes it was his device that brought Central City to 4005, and not the ionic vacuum Flash created. Zoral and Flash explain what really happened, and eventually Yom accepts their explanation. However, he reveals that scientists in 4005 are the only people not subjected to the anti-violence emitters. He is aware of Flash and the Cosmic Treadmill, and attempts to kill Flash so he can take the treadmill and integrate it into the quantum-time-shift-resolver.</p><p>Flash avoids Yom's attacks by slowing his molecular vibrations so that he slips backward in time to five minutes earlier, where he grabs Zoral's anti-violence gun and shoots Dr. Yom with it. Under the gun's effects, Yom realizes the immorality of his plans, and allows Flash to send Central City back to 1968. Flash and Zoral say their goodbyes, and Flash returns to his own time, where he and Iris are reunited.</p>",,,,,,,False,144014,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/4107433-%24_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",184,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]",The Executioner of Central City,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-55680/', 'id': 55680, 'name': 'Cosmic Treadmill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cosmic-treadmill/4055-55680/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-34476/', 'id': 34476, 'name': 'Frank Robbins', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-robbins/4040-34476/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9070/', 'id': 9070, 'name': 'Mike Esposito', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-esposito/4040-9070/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29364/', 'id': 29364, 'name': 'Ross Andru', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ross-andru/4040-29364/', 'role': 'penciler'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-184-the-executioner-of-central-city/4000-144014/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"

En route into town, with their houseguest, Stacy Conwell, the Allens overhear a radio broadcast, concerning three tornadoes closing on Central City. Moving faster than the eye can see, Allen exits the car, races to Central City, grabs a mannequin, then he places it in the middle of the road. Allen returns to the driver's seat without West, or Conwell, ever knowing that Allen left.</p><p>Spying a ""body"" laying in the road, Allen stops the car, and gets out to investigate. West and Conwell drive on into town. Now free to act, Allen, as the Flash, races off to deal with the tornadoes. The Flash dissipates the first two tornadoes, by generating a counter force at super-speed. The third tornado, however, turns out to be a trap, which sucks the Flash inside. The Flash is bombarded with Cosma-Spurs, a lethal form of energy recently discovered in the 25th Century.</p><p>Outside the tornado trap, the Flash's arch-nemesis, Professor Zoom announces himself as the villain. The third tornado dissipates, leaving behind only the empty, smoking uniform of the Flash. West hears the news of the Flash's demise, on the radio, just after dropping Conwell at the dentist. Suddenly, Allen appears at the window. Allen explains how he escaped from Professor Zoom's death trap. To flush out Professor Zoom, Allen decides to let the world continue to believe he is dead.</p><p>Allen drives West to several appointments, showing up later and later to pick her up, after each one. Back at home, West reads Allen the riot act over his chronic tardiness. West seizes Allen's wrist, noting that his watch is showing the correct time. West had set it several minutes ahead, in an attempt to get Allen to actually be on time for a change. West suddenly realizes that Allen didn't set the correct time, but that the watch, itself, is not the same.</p><p>Having seen through his ruse, Professor Zoom reveals himself, dropping the illusion of Allen he had cast about himself. Spinning a yard stick at super-human speed, Professor Zoom threatens to murder West. Suddenly, Professor Zoom is knocked into unconsciousness. At super-human speed, Allen had vibrated his way out of Professor Zoom's trap, only to find he was unable to slow down enough to become visible, or tangible again. It was only when he saw his wife about to be murdered, that he was able to return to normal, and take Professor Zoom down.</p><h3><ins>""World That Bet On War""</ins></h3><p>The Green Lantern encounters a spatial anomaly. Protected by his power ring, the Green Lantern is pulled into the vortex, ending up on a battlefield, during World War II. His attempts to communicate with the tank crew firing on him are met with more ammunition. On the planet Que, a pair of alien gamblers, Brrmm and Thrrl, argue over which race possess superior military armaments. After agreeing to a wager, the aliens create a no man's land to pit an alien tank against a terrestrial tank. After teleporting the alien tank to the battlefield, the aliens open a hole in time to procure the terrestrial tank.</p><p>While dodging the tank fire, the Green Lantern gets caught up in, and trips over, a barb wire barrier. To save himself from certain death, the Green Lantern surrounds the tank with a force field. Suddenly, the tank begins to vanish. Acting quickly, the Green Lantern uses his power ring to latch onto the tank, fading away with it. Transported to the alien battlefield, the Green Lantern succumbs to the tranquilizers in the atmosphere.

Abra Kadabra channels the power of an ion storm, through his body, to escape his prison cell, and travel back into the 20th Century. Despite Horton's need to discuss the Flash's case, the Flash breaks away from her. The Flash pays a visit to Central City Police Headquarters, to speak with Police Captain, Darryl Frye. The Flash learns the details surrounding the execution of Horton's father, Police Sargent, Jack O'Malley, at the hands of Goldface. Horton discusses the Flash's trial with her assistant, Dwayne. Something about one of the jurors, Nathan Newbury, unsettles Dwayne.</p><p>Horton, however, is far more interested in the daily presence of Doctor Henry, and Nora, Allen, at the trial. Seemingly they have no connection to the Flash, yet seem highly invested in the outcome of the trial. The Flash spirits Horton away to Fairview Cemetery, and the gravesite of her father, O'Malley. Goldface had murdered O'Malley, in an attempt to curb the Flash's interference, in his criminal enterprises. Goldface threatened to execute police officer after police officer, if the Flash continued to operate in Central City. Horton believes that the Flash willfully defied Goldface's edict, thus instigating the death of her father.</p><p>In reality, Goldface murdered O'Malley, before issuing his ultimatum to the Flash. Prison officials confirm Abra Kadabra's escape, as well as his likely return to the 20th Century. Horton has a nightmare, causing her to question the exact circumstances regarding her father's murder. Horton travels upstate, to speak directly with Curtis Kenyon, the notorious Goldface. Kenyon confirms Horton's belief, that the Flash had advance warning of Kenyon's intentions, and defied the ultimatum, resulting in O'Malley's death. An attack helicopter blows a hole in the prison wall.  Kenyon snatches O'Malley's gold watch from Horton, as he escapes from the prison.</p><p>Horton grabs Kenyon, as they are both drawn into the helicopter. The Flash just manages to leap onto the helicopter, as it pulls away from the prison. Kenyon returns O'Malley's watch to Horton, confesses that he actually killed her father prior to issuing his ultimatum to the Flash, then throws Horton out of the helicopter. The Flash destroys the helicopter's rotor, before leaping after Horton. By descending in a spiral pattern, the Flash is able to break their fall, landing in a nearby lake. Horton apologizes to the Flash, for wrongfully holding him responsible for her father's death. Horton considers the breaking of her father's watch, on impact with the lake, as a sign that it's time for her to put the past behind her. District Attorney, Anton Slater, calls his star witness to the stand, Kid Flash.</p>",,,,,,,False,144016,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/84205/3469702-%24%28kgrhqvhjegfj%2Cqwgijvbsb1sozjsg~~60_57.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",343,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-54995/', 'id': 54995, 'name': 'Central City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/central-city/4020-54995/'}]","""Revenge and Revelations!""",[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-18149/', 'id': 18149, 'name': 'Ben Oda', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ben-oda/4040-18149/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4346/', 'id': 4346, 'name': 'Carmine Infantino', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carmine-infantino/4040-4346/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41025/', 'id': 41025, 'name': 'Cary Bates', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cary-bates/4040-41025/', 'role': 'writer, editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-27780/', 'id': 27780, 'name': 'Frank McLaughlin', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/frank-mclaughlin/4040-27780/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-343-revenge-and-revelations/4000-144016/,,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/story_arc/4045-58229/', 'id': 58229, 'name': '""The Flash"" The Trial of the Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash-the-trial-of-the-flash/4045-58229/'}]",[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-1995/', 'id': 1995, 'name': 'The Flash', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-flash/4050-1995/'}"
