consider himself a man, owing to the fact that he has lost his hand to a sabertooth tiger. He enters a cave and finds a woman in there. He hides in the shadow so the woman cannot see him. The woman approaches offering solicitude, but the man misinterprets her actions as pity, and for that he kills her. Her soul is then pulled away.</p><p>Now, 1200 BC, on Mount Olympus, the gods are arguing. Artemis wishes to create a new mortal race, but Ares says that if that happens, he is to take lead. Artemis does not want that to happen as she fears the mortals will fear the gods rather than look up to them. Athena backs Artemis, saying that Ares will eventually destroy them all. The debate then moves on to the sex of the new race. Zeus is angry, saying that it doesn't matter if the race is created or not, as it should be left with the gods who are involved to settle it themselves. Artemis then asks Hera to intervene for her against Zeus, but she doesn't want to as Zeus is still angry. Ares also leaves angry, stating that all gods, even Zeus shall be under his thumb. The gods and goddesses involved proceed with the plan, along with Zeus' blessings. Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Aphrodite and Hestia travel to Hell, where Hades lives, to the Cavern of Souls. This was the place where Gaea had gathered souls of tortured women. The goddesses casted a spell which transported the souls to Greece where they are used on Amazons. The first one is Hippolyta and then Antiope and grants them the gifts of the goddesses. Hippolyta is made queen as the both of them are given the Girdles of Gaea. However, one soul remains, and that one is yet to be used.</p><p>The Amazons are successful at first, but because of that, Greek kings become jealous and the Amazons then become outcasts. Heracles and Thesus with his men approach Themyscira. Menalippe has foreseen this day and dreads it. Heracles and and Hippolyta fight each other, and Hippolyta defeats him. Heracles then considers them allies. Overtime, the Amazons gain their good reputation back. Heracles and his men with the Amazons are fine with each other, becoming good friends, but Menalippe has a strange feeling about this. Hippolyta is drugged by Heracles and wakes to find herself chained. He takes her girdle and leaves.</p><p>Hippolyta prays, hoping that the gods will forgive her for failing them. Athena frees them, hoping that they will redeem themselves as they fight the rest of the men on the island. Antiope however is angry and wishes to take revenge on Heracles. Hippolyta tells her that if she did this, she would not be a true Amazon as they would never do this. Antiope parted with some of the Amazons and set out to find Heracles. Poseidon parts a path, and for three months, the Amazons walk to their new destination, hoping to rebuild Themyscira in a new location. Upon arriving, they build their new city. After 30 centuries, Hippolyta wishes to have a child and the gods order her to make a baby out of clay. With the final soul, they imbue the clay baby with it, and with it, the child has great abilities. She is named Diana and she is deemed one of the greatest warriors. The gods cry out that Ares has gone made and is planning to take over and that someone must face him alone. Diana wishes to take part, but her mother does not allow her too. Come to the tournament in which a winner will be chosen to face Ares, they were to wear masks to bring their full potential out, in case their were any close friends competing. Diana competes and wins and is awarded these silver bracelets. Diana explains that Athena asked her to do this, and Menalippe tells Hippolyta that the gods had her to do this, and that she shouldn't question it, as it was for the greater good.</p><p>Diana needs to pass one last test however. In the temple of Hades, Philippus aims a gun at her and fires three times, but Diana blocks the bullets with her revolver. She asks her mother where such bracelets came from, but her mother would rather not answer, as now was not the best time. She is also fitted with a new costume, after Diana Trevor, who she was named after.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>32 pages and no ads.</li><li>""<em>The Wonder of it All</em>"" front inside

On Paradise Island, Diana is preparing for her mission. The goddesses are waiting for Hephaestus who is making the two Girdles of Gaea into the Lasso of Truth. It is then given to Artemis, then to Hermes who takes Diana by the hand as they disappear into a flash of light. Meanwhile, Trevor's plane loses control and goes into a spin but he manages to pull it back up. Diana and Hermes are flying above the home of Ares, and enters his home. He meets a woman named Harmonia who is the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite and gives her half an amulet. All of a sudden, Hermes calls Diana, telling her that her home is in trouble.</p><p>The Amazons are preparing for a battle as a plane is seen flying out from the clouds and Trevor's co-pilot, Captain Slade, starts strangling him. Slade's skills were needed to fly through the thunderstorm, but it will seem as if Trevor will be the one who causes the death of the Amazons. Slade sees Diana flying towards the plane and he drops the bomb but Diana catches it and throws it back to the plane which explodes and falls to the sea. Diana swims into the water where Themis is guiding her to Trevor, as Slade's body dissolves due to the fact that he was possessed by Ares.</p><p>Candy then tells General Hillary of what has happened and tries to find out why it happened, but Kohler himself has dissolved too. Back at Paradise Island, Athena tells Diana that to defeat Ares, she will need to find the other half of the amulet. At the air force base, Trevor is being questioned about his meeting with Kohler. Then we cut to Phobos and Deimos who are watching these events.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""<em>Bridging the Gap</em>"" one page text piece by Karen Berger.</li><li>Contains a black and

Hermes tells her not to judge too harshly, as Diana was put on Earth to put an end to Ares' mad plans.</p><p>At the Hanscom Air Force Base Hospital, General Hillary and Etta Candy demand to see Steve Trevor as one of the night nurses saw Trevor in a bed, having no idea how he got there and had wounds, but he was clearly healing. They reach the room in which Trevor is staying in, and see General Tolliver. He explains that Trevor is put under arrest as he did not return the Phantom Jet and he is a suspect under the murder of General Kohler.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hermes and Diana are to meet someone who will mentor and guide Diana through Man's World. Hermes also gives her Mad Harmonia's Talisman and tells her that he cannot help her from now on. In the campus library, Dr. Julia Kapatelis is seen reaching for a book on the top shelf on a ladder. She misses the reach and falls back, but Diana catches her. Kapatelis thanks her and Diana asks her if she is alright, but Kapatelis cannot understand her. Diana, frustrated that Kapatelis cannot understand her, reaches out for the Talisman and shows her. Kapatelis is amazed by this, as she has not seen this kind of artifact before. She reaches to touch it, and images of warrior women, whispering voices and a golden kiss and yet despite all that, there is hope. Then in a second it is gone as Diana stares blankly at her. She is knocked out on the floor, she wants to find out who Diana is, and believes the Talisman is the key to it. Diana still cannot understand Kapatelis and tells her in broken Greek, that she will help her as a smiling Diana replies ""Please call me Diana.""</p><p>Meanwhile, Phobos is watching on and is not happy about it. His brother, Deimos would take time to create a plan, but Phobos wishes to attack when the moment is just right. He walks to the giant, beating heart of Gorgon and removes a mass of flesh from it, blowing on it and creating a small statue. Deimos is somewhere in America, where he is making a speech.</p><p>Back in Boston, Diana is getting used to the bustling noise of traffic and honking horns. Kapatelis assures Diana that she will get used to it. Later that night at Hansom air base, Tolliver is questioning Trevor and tells him that he cannot remember anything after the plane went down. Tolliver asks him to remember harder, and Trevor remembers being attacked by his co-pilot, spotting an island and being saved from a strange woman he had never seen before. Tolliver then tells Trevor that with Kohler dead, no one else can prove it. Trevor, confused, questions this when the nurse comes in with a syringe. Before the nurse can insert it, Trevor knocks her out, claiming that she had filled the syringe with air, hoping to block his blood vessels. Tolliver then punches Trevor exclaiming that their plan has come too far to be interfered with. Steve pushes Tolliver across the room and the guard comes in. Trevor then pushes him out of the way and is shot by Tolliver just as he was about to escape.</p><p>At the same moment, Vanessa Kapatelis answers the door when a delivery man comes in, saying that a package has come for Julia. She opens the package and there is the small statue.</p><p>Etta Candy is in shock as she hears what happens. Colonel Michaelis explains that Trevor is accused of murdering a guard during his escape. Etta is stunned by this and goes into the bathroom as a hand reaches out from the curtain and covers her mouth and she discovers that it is Steve. He explains that people are out to get him, and to not believe a word they say.</p><p>Deimos is somewhere Russia where he is making a speech, the same as before, but to a Russian audience.</p><p>Diana and Julia finally arrive home, with Diana carrying a large pile of books - Julia cannot believe what strength this woman has. As Vanessa comes down from upstairs, she comments on Diana's costume. Diana is surprised to find such a young woman on Man's World. Julia tells Vanessa that Diana will be staying for a while, but Vanessa doesn't seem too happy about it, asking ""... a little while?"" Julia explains that she needs to teach Diana English so that she can decipher the Talisman and an agitated Vanessa stomps back upstairs. Julia aplogises for Vanessa's behaviour, as she is not usually like this.</p><p>Julia and Diana are in the study room at midnight, and Julia is shocked by how fast Diana can learn the basics in English. Then, the small statue's eyes begin to glow. Vanessa screams as Decay appears and sees Vanessa aged from Decay's touch. Diana warns Julia not to touch Decay and tells Diana come and feel her touch. Diana refuses and Decay unleashes her demon breath blast above Diana's and Julia's heads as the room begins to collapse on top of them.</p><h4><strong>Notes:</strong></h4><ul><li>The cover is a homage

Decay has a hold of Diana's tiara and dares her to approach her to grab the tiara. Neighbours gather around to see what the commotion is, as Decay laughs an evil laugh and shoots up to the sky. Diana looks high and low in the sky for Decay while the Olympus gods question whether she is suited for the job of defeating Ares. However, Hermes has faith in Diana as it has been decreed that if the Man's World were to survive, then their salvation must come at Diana's hands.</p><p>Meanwhile at Hanscom Air Force Base, Etta Candy is searching through General Tolliver's office, looking for Steve Trevor's file. She finds it, and marked on it is ""Ares Project"". She takes photos of it, and carefully locks up, taking caution. Then the night guard calls her over and points her to the TV, in which a report of a glowing object is seen in the sky. The local foliage has also begun to rot. Moments later, the reporter reports that the decay is spreading all over the city.</p><p>Across the city, Decay unleashes her breath much like a hurricane. The Boston Massacre Monument soon topples over but Diana catches it just in time, saving people right under it. Holding the monument, she tosses it at Decay but before it can even reach her, it turns into powder. More of the press arrive, as Decay tells Diana about the humiliating death she will soon suffer. Diana fights back with a ""Or yours Decay... once I get my hands on you!"" but she reminds Diana that she has created so much havoc in Boston City, and she has hardly lifted a finger.</p><p>Diana charges for Decay but her emotions have clouded her thinking, and she forgets about Decay's special touch. Diana starts aging, yet she tells Decay that she will not admit defeat. Decay tells her that she will turn into dust and be one with the Earth. Then, Diana remembers the Lasso of Truth - she wraps it around Decay's neck, as the lasso always renews, as Gaea renews the Earth. Decay continues to struggle as ironically, the lasso pours life into Decay, who is made of death. Decay, screaming, explodes and her body falls to the ground, turning into dust.</p><p>The camera crews rush over the Decay's carcass, as Wonder Woman flies down to put her tiara back where it rightfully belongs. The camera crews then suddenly rush over to her, and she is surrounded by flashes and questions she does not understand. Confused, she flies back up, looking for Julia.</p><p>Meanwhile, Phobos is furious at Deimos' plan of Decay. Deimos fires energy blasts at him and Phobos is hanging over the edge. Deimos tells him that his attempt at killing Diana may have ruined Ares' plans and lets Deimos to fall.</p><p>In Boston, the editor for the Boston Globe-Leader Newspaper, Carole Bennett stares at the photo of Diana. Realising that the Daily Planet's sales skyrocketed after Superman appeared, she knew that she had to have Diana on the front page. She needed a name for her. She noticed a bird of some sort and a stylised ""W"". She smiles as an idea comes to her. The following morning, the city is buzzing with the front page having Diana and the title """"Wonder Woman! Mystery heroine saves city from Deadly Demon of Destruction"".</p><p>In northern Boston, Etta returns home from shopping and enters her house as Steve is sitting on the lounge, shocked that the woman on TV was the same woman who saved him. With that, Steve sets out to find Diana along with Etta. Little do they know that Colonel Michaelis is following them.</p><p>Vanessa is at Mercy General Hospital where the doctors do not know what is wrong with her. The doctors cannot heal her and as they leave, Julia starts crying. She then hears a voice, Diana's voice in fact. Julia is filled with joy and asks her if she has found a cure. Diana still doesn't understand English very well but shows the Talisman and through that, tells her that this is Julia's fight as well.</p><p>They both arrive back at home and Julia studies the Talisman as Diana looks out the window. Just then, she sees a shadow amongst the trees and Julia finds herself alone. Julia looks around for Diana as a gun is trained on her when Diana wraps the lasso around the man's wrist. They then recognise each other and Steve asks for her help again. Diana does not trust him though, as he was the messenger of death. Suddenly, Etta shrieks as Colonel Michaelis is seen holding a gun with Etta against the car, unconscious.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""<em>Wonder Woman</em>"" the title and first appearance of the letter column.</li></ul><p> </p>",,,,,,,False,28091,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/25265-3824-28091-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",4,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/massachusetts/4020-55745/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55708/', 'id': 55708, 'name': 'Mount Olympus', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mount-olympus/4020-55708/'}]",A Long Day's Journey into Fright!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-58567/', 'id': 58567, 'name': 'Amulet of Harmonia', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/amulet-of-harmonia/4055-58567/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41435/', 'id': 41435, 'name': 'Lasso of Truth', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51517/', 'id': 51517, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Bracelets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-bracelets/4055-51517/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56852/', 'id': 56852, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Earrings"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-earrings/4055-56852/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51489/', 'id': 51489, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Tiara"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4105/', 'id': 4105, 'name': 'Bruce Patterson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bruce-patterson/4040-4105/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2913/', 'id': 2913, 'name': 'George Pérez', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/george-perez/4040-2913/', 'role': 'writer, artist, penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43437/', 'id': 43437, 'name': 'Karen Berger', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/karen-berger/4040-43437/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-41457/', 'id': 41457, 'name': 'Len Wein', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/len-wein/4040-41457/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-8294/', 'id': 8294, 'name': 'Tatjana Wood', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tatjana-wood/4040-8294/', 'role': 'colorist'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman-4-a-long-days-journey-into-fright/4000-28091/,1987-02-05,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-57401/', 'id': 57401, 'name': 'Gods of Olympus', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gods-of-olympus/4060-57401/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-3824/', 'id': 3824, 'name': 'Wonder Woman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman/4050-3824/'}"

his influence is obviously growing as the flowers in Themyscira start dying. Menalippe stares into her cauldron and Hippolyta impatiently waits for the future. Hippolyta suspects that she is hiding something and as can only tell her about the evil that lies underneath this island. Why does Apollo not answer their prayers? Meanwhile in Mount Olympus, Artemis tries to wake her brother, Apollo up. He accuses him of being a coward, but Hermes replies saying that he usually takes a pragmatic approach to most situations. Artemis says that they should face their fate on their feet, not lying down. Artemis refuses to believe that this is happening to her but Athena responds that it is up to Diana to save them.</p><p>On Man’s World, Steve Trevor is still considered a murderer and at a press conference General Sam Tolliver claims that he is a spy. The whereabouts of Wonder Woman are still unknown as the police offer a reward for anyone that has some information on her. Unknown to the public, Diana is at Julia Kapatelis’ house caring for Etta treating the bump in her head. She asks Colonel Michaelis what is going on and Michaelis apologises and said that he had startled her and she tripped. Steve also wants to help Diana, but it is up to her with what to do next. Etta is confused, so Diana produces the Talisman and tells them that is has something to do with this. Etta disagrees and brings out the file that she stole. Diana reads it and finds it says “The Ares Project”.</p><p>Under Earth, Deimos holds his Talisman and feels the excitement that their plan will finally take off. Phobos however still feels worthless for failing to please his father and intends to do something about it.</p><p>Hours later at the Kapatelis house, Julia is trying to decipher it if and Diana asks if she has deciphered it. Apparently, the marks translate into geometric patterns with a focal point in the Vulture. Diana tells Julia to go to sleep and she feels that this pattern looks familiar. She wonders if the others can help, but they are fast asleep as Steve had pinned up a chart. The chart looks exactly like the mark on the Talisman. She wakes the others, claiming that she has found the answer.</p><p>Elsewhere, General Tolliver and his troops take over a secret military factory.</p><p>Back at the winter retreat, everyone is around a map. It seems that when the mirror image of the Talisman is held over the map it marks the bloodiest battles of Ancient Greece and when it is laid over the map of Earth, it points to all these nuclear bases. It then points to the upper Midwestern United States and must be the focal point for the Ares Project.</p><p>Colonel Michaelis phones General Hillary telling him that the world is at stake, then General Hillary’s aide bursts in to inform him that one of their military bases has been taken over by rogue troops. The base is also ready for a nuclear launch. Michealis, hearing this over the phone tells him that it is too late. Steve finds out and plans to stop him, but they need a plan first. Diana comes out in her costume and tells them that they need to find the other half of the Talisman because joining them will lead her to Ares. Diana says that this is her job, but Julia insists that they come along. Even though Diana says no, Steve, Etta and Michaelis grab their weapons, and Diana realises that her friends will stand by her no matter what. Diana wonders why they do so when they are so frail compared to her. As Diana slowly connects the Talisman in the mirror, and Etta questions why they put so much faith in her. Steve cannot explain, but Diana reminds him of his mother. The Talisman touches it’s reflection in the mirror, and the world then turns totally upside down, where it is hot as Hell and as cold as ice. Then, they find themselves in the domain of Deimos. He also convinces Diana to try and get the other half of the amulet. Julia then asks Diana who he is and he introduces himself as Deimos, “son of Ares, Master of Duplicity and Sovereign of the Serpents!” Then, several snakes attack Diana causing her to drop the amulet. Julia picks it up as Steve fires on the snakes. The others join in on the fight, and Phobos watches on. Even though Phobos does not really enjoy his brother’s company, he cannot see him be beaten by mortals. He uses his powers to bring up the things that they fear the most. Diana finishes up on the snakes and goes for the large cat in which Michealis fears and hits it with a mighty punch. Michealis tells Steve that he will take care of his fear, and that Steve should help the others. Julia’s fear was drowning and Diana saves her from it while Steve digs Etta out, as her fear is being buried alive. Phobos is about to attack him but before he can, Michaelis fires upon him allowing Steve to save Etta. She is free, but Phobos then unleashes his power on them.</p><p>Deimos tells Wonder Woman that her friends cannot stand up to the gods. Wonder Woman lays Julia on the ground, exclaiming that she does not fear him. Deimos disagrees however and turns her hair into snakes and her snake hairs inject their venom into them. Julia says that she will help, but Diana rejects her help, saying that she must defeat him alone. She looks around, and her friends are unconscious. She then uses her tiara to cut through her hair and then decapitating Deimos. Wonder Woman goes over to his dead corpse and takes the other half of the amulet from him and Phobos flees. Julia asks what they shall do as the others come to. The amulet comes together and they vanish into the control room of a missile base surrounded by General Tolliver’s troops. He points towards a screen to show a missile that is preparing to launch and tell them to witness his victory. The missile is then surrounded in a strange light, and the weapon takes on a new form. Wonder Woman knows to well who this is: Ares.</p>",,,,,,,False,28193,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/25360-3824-28193-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url':

Inside the missile base, Wonder Woman, Etta, Steve, Julia and Michealis look on in horror as Ares stands there. Ares tells Wonder Woman to enjoy her final moments because she won’t be able to enjoy them anymore. Tolliver is holding the launch key to the missiles and as he goes on ranting, Etta, Steve and Michaelis secretly take out their smoke grenades and when Michealis gives the go, Wonder Woman should take down Tolliver. She is unhappy with them risking their lives, but Julia replies by saying that they will die otherwise if they don’t do something about it. Wonder Woman does not know how long she will be able keep up from the hair that Deimos turned into snakes. Tolliver orders his troops to keep Wonder Woman down as a distraction so he can grab the missile key near her feet. Wonder Woman with all strength throws them off her, as Tolliver escapes through the door, but Steve manages to follow him just as the doors shut behind him. Wonder Woman tries to follow him by pushing the doors apart but she can’t. Why will Ares not face her? Why does he hide behind a mortal? Suddenly, Wonder Woman is surrounded by a white light and vanishes into a black void.</p><p>Meanwhile, Steve races down the corridor and finds that Tolliver has already inserted the key. Steve warns him not to do it, but Tolliver has no intention of doing it and this causes Steve to fire upon him and the General falls to the ground. Steve goes to get the key, but a hand grabs him, Tolliver’s hand in fact.</p><p>In the black void, Wonder Woman then hears crackling thunder and a demonic laugh. Wonder Woman is facing Ares right now, telling her that her answer to challenge him as been answered and she should face him. Wonder Woman asks why he is doing this, and he replies that he is only fulfilling the ancient prophecy, where Uranus was slain by his son Chronus, who was then slain by his son Zeus, and now it was Ares’ turn. A portal then shows what is happening back on Earth. Steve is fighting with the Tolliver whose soul has been taken over by demonic spirits and there are streets on the riot. Then, Paradise Island is shown where the trees and flowers are dying. Phillipus asks Hippolyta if there is any word from Diana, but Hippolyta replies that nothing has been heard. However, Phillipus believes that if Diana were gone, they would have joined her by now, so there is always hope.</p><p>Wonder Woman launches herself at Ares as he unleashes a godly power blast from himself. He tells her that he is too powerful and she cannot defeat him and he grabs her by the throat. Ares is choking her and she starts to loss her consciousness, but Wonder Woman reaches the amulet and throws it to Ares’ head. He cries in pain and gets angry, swinging a punch at her. Suddenly, flames appear around her, burning her. The portal opens up once again, showing Etta, Julia and Michealis frantically trying to override the base’s security systems. They succeed, but then see Tolliver’s dead troops come back to life. Ares comments on her, saying that if she can’t save her friends, how could she save the world against him? Wonder Woman feel frustrated as she has a hard time defeating Ares and why won’t the gods answer her prayers?</p><p>At the stores of the River Styx, Artemis says to Athena that Diana has failed them, though Athena replies that she must have faith in Diana. Persephone asks them to come aboard the ship, but Athena and Artemis refuse as the conflict is not yet over.</p><p>Wonder Woman is surrounded in flames as Ares mocks her. Then slowly, she rises to her feet and unties the golden item she holds: the Lasso of Truth. She twirls it above her head, ready to tie Ares up and that exclaims that she is here to stop this madness. Ares then fires a bolt at her, and she dodges it and captures Ares in her lasso. Ares screams and then the black void disrupts itself as Diana falls backwards and is barely alive. Ares then can see the mushroom clouds showing that the missiles have been launched. But then he sees himself as the leader of the world, but he is alone and that his kingdom is nothing more than rubble. The Lasso of Truth has made him see the consequences of his ways. He starts to weep and he realises that with no one to worship him, he is nothing. A weak Wonder Woman tells him that this is all true and he can stop this before it is too late. He looks at Wonder Woman and agrees and he holds the amulet in his hand and the balance is once restored. Ares tells her that Tolliver is finished. From this moment on, Man must decide its own fate and its own destruction will keep Ares alive, but he alone cannot take over and it is up to Wonder Woman to save Man from itself. If she is not Wonder Woman, then Man’s World would not hear from him again, proving that everything needs balance, that they provide for each other as Ares cannot exist with Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman without Ares. With a wave of his hand, Ares sends Wonder Woman back to Man’s World.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the control centre, General Hillary has his own troops there and has been confronted by Tolliver’s dead men who flame up and disintegrate. Medics are taking care of Julia and Etta, but Michealis had died while shielding the two women from the gunfire. Then, Steve comes in with Wonder Woman, lifeless, in his arms saying ""For god's sake, will somebody please help me with her?!""</p>",,,,,,,False,28305,"{'icon_url':

is finally over. Zeus is filled with joy and decrees that today is a day of celebration. Zeus tells Athena that her Amazons were up to the task and Athena agrees, saying that their faith in the Amazons have helped them defeat Ares.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Themyscira, Diana undergoes a process of healing. The Amazons lay Diana’s body in the water, though she did not seem to be responding to the healing. It’s more than just a physical wound; it also seems to be spiritual as well. The gods look on to what is happening and Artemis pleads with Zeus to intervene and help them. Pan comments on their island and how it is solely run by women, but his father, Hermes, tells him to contain himself as they women are special people. Zeus decides to let Diana live as Diana’s mother, Hippolyta had been able to level with Heracles, Zeus’ son. Zeus calls on Poseidon, the god of the sea. On the Island of Healing, the skies become grey and stormy and the Amazons watch in awe as Diana’s body is surrounded by froth and bubbles and she sinks slowly to the ocean bed. Poseidon summons Neriedes to give her the gentle touch that will heal all the harm that has been done to her.</p><p>The Amazons watch in anticipation and Hippolyta wonders if something has gone wrong, but Epione implores her that they all must keep their faith in the gods. Suddenly, a shaft of light explodes up from the waters and Diana is reborn once again. Zeus tells Hippolyte that she has served him well, and her daughter's life is a reward for her devotion and faithful service. Epione feels this is a bitter-sweet however, at the joy of Diana’s return but the fore-boding words of Zeus. This has also seemed to concern the goddesses. Artemis tells Athena that she does not trust Zeus and Athena agrees that Pan's roaming eyes had turned Zeus' affectionate eyes to the mighty Amazons. Hera tells them not to worry. Hera admits she did not have faith in the Amazons until Diana's success in Man's World, and her love for Zeus has a tremendous power to cloud her judgment. But she hints that she has decided to act differently because Zeus has betrayed her devotion.</p><p>A few days later, Hippolyta and Diana discuss her return to Man’s World. Hippolyta refuses to allow her to go back, as she almost died doing so. But Diana insists that her work is not done, and that Ares will return soon. Besides, she has made friends and wants to learn what happened to them. Young Vanessa's life is threatened, and Diana believes it is honorable to return and help Vanessa as thanks for what they have done for her. Yet Hippolyte still hesitates to let her return to Man's World without a sign from the gods to help her make that final decision. Suddenly, Athena appears from the clouds and leaves a gift--a pair of winged sandals from Hermes--which will allow Diana to travel from Paradise Island to Man’s World at will. This is a sure sign that the gods want Diana to return to the Man’s World. Hippolyte says that even though she cannot question the gods, and Diana must abide by Hippolyte's restrictions before the Amazon Queen will grant Diana leave to walk amongst men again.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Meredith Military Medical Center in Boston, Vanessa Kapatelis lies dying from old age. Lieutenant Etta Candy and General Hillary watch as the doctors say that they cannot do anything to help her. Etta's explanation about the events is unsatisfactory to General Hillary. Hillary bemoans the missing star-spangled lady; without her as supporting evidence, the amazing defeat of the rogue soldiers at the military base is way too flimsy to be respected by anyone. A Code Red emergency is announced for Vanessa’s surgery room. The guards outside Vanessa's room are lying on the floor unconscious when Etta and Hillary arrive. A doctor tells them not to panic as they step inside. Wonder Woman is applying a salve from Paradise Island. Vanessa’s life signs suddenly start growing stronger. Etta is happy to see Diana, but she tells her the unfortunate death of Michaelis. Diana asks to see Julia. General Hillary immediately orders a car for her.</p><p>At the university, there is a knock on the door. Julia Kapatelis opens the door, expecting to see Etta, but is greeted by a woman wearing a fur coat and smoking a cigarette. She introduces herself as Myndi Mayer, a publicist. She asks if she can see Wonder Woman, making it worthwhile for Julia. The phone rings and Julia answers it. On the other end is Etta, telling her that Vanessa is okay. After Julia hangs up the phone, Myndi tells Julia that she'll pay money to meet Wonder Woman. Julia takes the cigarette from Myndi’s mouth, douses it in a coffee mug, and slams the door behind her. Myndi realizes that if she is going to get on Julia’s good side, she needs to find a way.</p><p>Julia makes her to way to the hospital. Etta greets her and escorts Julia to Vanessa’s room. Julia sees her nearly recovered daughter in bed and smiling. Julia is overjoyed and starts crying. She asks Wonder Woman: How she can ever repay her? Wonder Woman replies that Vanessa’s smile is enough of a repayment. Wonder Woman admits that she has only a limited amount of time before she must return to Themyscira. General Hillary interrupts and says that Vanessa and Diana needs a debriefing. Wonder Woman is confused by the word, debriefing, but Hillary assures her that it is nothing complicated. He just needs some answers why Tolliver’s men went berserk. Vanessa asks Julia why they are picking on Diana. Julia decides there is a way to get the message across to the public before the military completely screws anything up. Julia then steps forward and asks if she can speak with Diana, and tells him that she is certain that she can help Diana out.</p><p>In Boston downtown, Diana is now wearing her tiara, a black blouse and skirt as she and Julia arrive at the Myndi Mayer's publicity office. Diana wonders why she has to wear this clothing, and Julia replies that her star-spangled outfit would look a bit too conspicuous. Diana, Julia, and Myndi meet. Myndi describes the importance of publicity in making the public receptive to something new. To be successful, Diana must be welcomed into America society. First, Myndi suggests a need to change Princess Diana's name. Myndi claims that the Amazonian princess will be confused with “Princess Di” of England. She suggests a simple reversal of word to “Diana Prince.” Diana initially objects, saying that she wants people to know who she is. Myndi replies that the media has already come up with another name for her and that is Wonder Woman. She tells Diana to leave everything to her, and she will become famous. Julia warns that Diana is just not a freak show. ""Trust me"" replies Myndi, ""nothing but class!""</p><p>Some days later, Wonder Woman is a welcome public celebrity, though not everyone is thrilled by this new development. The Joint Chiefs of Staff convene for a special meeting and ask General Hillary for advice on how the military can fix the bad publicity generated from the Ares Assault. Hillary replies that he has sent Steve Trevor and Etta Candy on different assignments to keep them out of the public view with special orders to keep quiet regarding their involvement in the Ares Assault. Elsewhere, Steve is reading a newspaper. He sees the headlines and is glad to read that Diana has obtained the recognition she deserves. He also reads that Colonel Matt Michaelis' widow received the Medal the Honor for the colonel's acts of gallantry beyond the call of duty during the Ares Assault. Trevor also hopes that Diana will force the Top Brass to come clean so that Michaelis will not have died unnecessarily.</p><p>Meanwhile in Nottingham, England, archaeologist Barbara Minerva summons her servant Chuma. He brings in news articles about Wonder Woman. She tells him that Diana is a very fascinating person. Barbara also covets Diana's Lasso of Truth, forged from the Golden Girdle of the Earth-Goddess Gaea. She declares that the Golden Lasso is a prize should be hers. She orders Chuma to prepare the potion, which will transform her into the Cheetah.. She rants that if she cannot buy the Golden Lasso from Wonder Woman, she will be forced to take it from her. Chuma is worried for his mistress. She is becoming more insane by the minute. The best he can do is try to protect her, for he owes her his life. He plucks a leaf from the cursed plant so that the demi-supernatural Cheetah can live once more.</p>",,,,,,,False,28430,"{'icon_url':

poster of Wonder Woman hanging on the wall. She brings out her journal and starts writing in it. She writes that even though she was skeptical of Myndi Mayer, she also admits that she has done a good job in promoting Wonder Woman. Julia and Wonder Woman have been busy lately, as they have been preparing her for her appearance in front of the United Nations General Assembly. Julia would have preferred more time for rehearsal, but the time Hippolyta has given for her daughter was very limiting.</p><p>During the day of the interview, Julia was her interpreter, because Diana felt that her English still wasn’t as good, and Julia could also speak Themyscrian. Unfortunately, she discovers that some backward countries do not appreciate a woman who can lead and that the Russian delegate proposed that Diana’s costume was false advertising and thought that the Ares Affair was all fake and that she was a political propagandist. This confused her, as she wanted to find out more about these strange political problems in Man’s World.</p><p>Diana also accepted to prove to the military base that the Ares Affair was more than just a take over. Julia did not approve of this invitation and she was not allowed to accompany Diana as she went. Once she returned from the military base, she was different, as she asked Myndi Mayer to cancel all promotions and she was also quiet and contemplative. Julia thought that Diana finally understood how troubled Man’s World was compared to Paradise Island.</p><p>Coincidently, when Diana had become that changed person, Psychologist G. Gordon Godfrey began his campaign to ban all superheroes. His campaign seemed silly at first, but then it started gaining ground. Also, the America’s influential politicians started siding with him and in Julia’s class, she watched helplessly as her students divided themselves amongst each other. Because of her relationship with Diana, she found herself under the public eye. She was not liked because of having a superhero in her home and they showed their displeasure. Finally, a brick was thrown through her window, Diana couldn’t hold back anymore. After weeks of silence, she couldn’t stand it anymore and so began the fight for her rights. During the height of Godfrey’s campaign, that was when he ironically fell, as his arrogance had got the better of him and Diana found herself standing amongst other superheroes that were suppressed by him. At last, Diana found some belonging to Man’s World, but declined when they asked her to join the Justice League.</p><p>Later, Julia asked why Diana didn’t accept the invitation to join the Justice League. She replied that she did not believe in fighting in Man’s World with a costume, however, from that day, she kept discussing the people she met. The Black Canary was the first female crime fighter that she had met. There was also the Martian Manhunter from Mars, ironically named after a god called Ares, and Captain Marvel whose powers were also taken from gods. Also, when Julia was to talk about Superman, Diana would become quiet as if there was a secret between them two.</p><p>A day later after the Pentagon acknowledged Diana’s claims on the Ares Affair, Diana and Julia received a call from Colonel Michaelis’ widow, asking how her husband fought. Diana and Julia told her that he fought bravely, saving Etta and Julia’s lives. As they spoke, Diana also noticed that Julia had tears in her eyes. Julia would later confide in Diana telling her that she had never sensed so much of a loss of a loved one. Now Diana understood how her mother felt when Diana was to fight Ares. Some nights after, Julia finds Diana nude on the lawn praying to her Amazon gods and realises what a contradiction she is because on one hand, she is sweet, innocent and loving, but on the other hand, she is still looking for a proper outlet. Diana’s time on Man’s World is growing short as there is still much to do. Diana feels that Julia is the closet friend she will have while Julia feels that she is the closet goddess that she knows.</p><p>Meanwhile, aboard a plane, Barbara Minerva is on her way, planning to snatch the lasso from Diana.</p><p>In Etta Candy’s office at the air force base, she is studying Diana’s mugshots as she wishes she had a body like that. She then starts writing a letter to Steve Trevor. She tells him that she has got some information regarding the Ares Affair and has been asked to study the ""Wonder Woman Manoeuvres"". After they finished taking her vital statistics, General Hillary sent Diana to Major Dennis Warren and his research team.</p><p>By this time, Diana’s English was good enough to understand these test that Etta and Steve had stated in their reports. Perhaps this was also a chance to prove that her alliance with US was true as her own costume did indicate some kind of US look. At the test site, she was to be tested on her bracelets called Codename: Bullets and Bracelets, or as she liked to call it ""The Flashing Thunder"". She was also afraid that the equipment might be damaged from the ricochets. Etta wanted to protest against this as this was putting her in danger, but Diana reassured her that she was fine. She also stated that she had gone under a similar test on Paradise Island. It was a .45 magnum that was used, but how the gun got on the island was a mystery to her. Once on radioed command, the three soldiers who were holding Uzis fire upon her at point blank range. Etta is extremely worried, showing it by screaming but in a flurry motion which the cameras had difficulty capturing the bullets bounced off her. As the bullets bounced off, she charged the three men and disarmed them and crushed their weapons with her bare hands. Major Warren was also impressed with what she had done.</p><p>Etta was also impressed as Diana demonstrated her ability being able to hold a Tomcat fighter from flying. She lassoed the plane’s tail and just pulled on it like that and Major Warren had to ask the jet pilot to turn off the engine to keep it from being damaged. Diana also lifted the M1 Abraham Tank. Diana was going to destroy the plane and jet together though she realised that they were controlled by people inside them, and it seemed to annoy Major Warren that she would hold back from harming humans. Etta’s respect for her was also growing. The next test was where she had to prove her flying skills, where she out performed the jets. She said that she preferred this much more as no one was in danger and that she enjoyed the sensation of flying.</p><p>When the tests were over, Major Warren asked Diana if she could possibly replicate those bracelets and her lasso. Diana refused as these were gifts from the gods, not just weapons. Even though Diana proved herself, Major Warren was still unsure about her. Etta was ashamed of how the military were treating her, as she had come to help Man’s World, yet they were treating her like this. Diana stayed out of the public eye until the Godfrey affair blew over. Her acceptance by other heroes allowed General Hillary to drop charges against Diana, Etta, Julia, Steve and Michaelis.</p><p>At Boston airport, Minerva's Special Museum Permit is checked and she is allowed to bring in her exotic plant. Twenty minutes later, she is in a van driven by Tam, her contact. Tam asks her what she needs, but Minerva totally ignores him, intently reading on Wonder Woman’s Farewell Tour.</p><p>At the Kapatelis summer house in Massachusetts, Vanessa writes in her diary where she has received a copy of a photograph taken of her and Diana, and Vanessa is wearing the Wonder Woman bracelets and earrings given to her by Myndi. On the day, Vanessa finds out what a great person Diana is. Diana thinks Vanessa is beautiful and that she is the first young girl she has ever seen as Dian grew up the only child on Paradise Island. Vanessa writes in her diary how Paradise Island is like with beautiful scenery and crystal clear waters. The Amazons also do a lot of “homework” but Diana tells her that learning is a very important part of life. Vanessa also learns that Diana was the only Amazon granted with powers from the goddesses. Diana learns about Vanessa’s father, and this made Vanessa feel really lucky to have a father, even though it was a short time because Diana never had a father. Vanessa is also grateful that Diana saved her life and apologised for the way she treated her at first. Then, Diana felt as if she needed to fly around with Vanessa. They flew up and talked for hours and Diana told Vanessa that she was nervous about the talk at her school as sometimes the English language confused her.</p><p>The next day, Diana made her way to Vanessa’s school, and Diana’s English was perfect as all the girls were excited about her as they started imitating the Amazon salute where their arms crossed together like an “X” and the bracelets touch each other. Most of the boys listened too, but one boy was Barry who was very interested. Vanessa could tell because he never took her eyes off Diana and for that, Vanessa thought he was different from the other boys and maybe he will ask her out for the dance?</p><p>After school, Diana left and Vanessa and Barry were hanging out together when they both heard some boys behind a tree laughing and grunting. Barry pushed them aside and took the photo, where she was made to look disgusting and Vanessa was mortified to find boys like this drawing over her. Barry and Vanessa got into an argument with the boys when a teacher came to break it up and luckily, Vanessa’s mum used her influence to not get her suspended, but Julia was angry. Vanessa was to apologise to the boys as Diana would have not acted like this and Vanessa was grounded. Still, Vanessa got to see Barry and he gave her a picture of him, and told her that she was <em>his</em> Wonder Woman!</p><p>Back at Boston outside an apartment, Tam demands to see Minerva but Chuma refuses him entry. Tam asks why she has travelled across the globe and Chuma tells him that his answers will be shortly answered. A while later, Minerva makes her way to the plant where Chuma is tending the plant. All Diana needs now is to believe Minerva’s claim.</p><p>In Myndi Mayer’s office, she studies the huge poster for the “Wonder Woman Farewell Tour”. With the whole Godfrey thing over and the military believing her superhuman abilities, the tour couldn’t have been better. Diana was presented with the Key to the City and made an appearance on the Johnny Carson show. Though because of her busy schedule, she was the only superhero not to be honoured by him. With merchandise, the stores ran out very quickly with the stocks. She also had licensing with DC comics, having her comic come out every month and her own clothing line. Since Diana says that she will not be with them, the money is used to set up a foundation called the ""Wonder Woman Foundation"" showing the contributions made by women over 40 towards equality and advancement. There has also been an increasing number of complaints by Christian and Judaic leaders, questioning her beliefs with Greek gods. Julia is aware of this and Myndi tells Diana that the tour has finally taken its toll. The tour is almost over, but the fan mail is still coming in, and one letter strikes Myndi’s interest. If her claims are true, they could have a lot of publicity here. She reads out the letter, explaining how Minerva has been able to collect historical items and Diana’s lasso has fascinated her. Minerva then explains that she has been studying an historical item which supposedly in connected to the Lasso of Truth. Minerva believes that this is the second Girdle of Gaea and with this new discovery, more can be discovered about the Amazon’s origin.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a dark alley, a corpse was found as if it were attacked by an animal. They check the corpse’s I.D. discovering that the victim was Tamsyn McConnell, a small time guns smuggler and runner.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Story was divided into four chapters: Journal, Dispatch, Dear Diary, and ""Tour Update.""</li><li>George Perez, Len Wein and Karen Berger do not actually appear in this story.

Chuma has performed this ritual many times before, and he always wished that this was the last, as this was Minerva’s time to satisfy her taste for blood. He makes his way to Minerva and cuts her wrist and lets the blood drop down to a bowl. Then he takes the bowl to the plant and adds a sacred potion that he has been preparing for hours and pours it onto the plant and Chuma returns Minerva to her bed.</p><p>In the Massachusetts, things couldn’t be better as Wonder Woman is flying high in the sky while Myndi Mayer is enjoying her new found wealth. She comments on Minerva’s letter, stating that her letter couldn’t come at a better time and that it isn’t bad publicity either. Julia adds that Myndi would publicise Mother Teresa if she could. She apologises for her statement, only worried for Diana’s safety. Myndi cannot understand why Julia is worried, as Diana is higher than a kite. Julia warns Myndi warns her about Minerva, as she has been known about her reputation and her shady character. Even so, Myndi and Diana have discussed this and Diana is keen on meeting this Minerva. Later, Myndi and Diana go up to Minerva’s apartment and Diana is nervous. Myndi tells her to loosen up telling her that nothing will go wrong. But Diana insists that this is very nerve-wracking as this new artefact could change why she is here on Man’s World and affect the destiny of the Amazons. They arrive on her floor as Chuma shows them inside. Minerva asks Chuma to prepare some refreshments for the guests as she asks Diana if she has the Lasso of Truth and Diana reaches in her handbag and brings out the lasso and asks her to bring her artefact down. She asks Diana to wait as she goes upstairs to retrieve it, but her speech begins to waver and then she slowly states that there is no such artefact. She weakens at the look of the lasso and she falls to the ground as her assistant tends to her. Diana picks up the lasso and tears begin to run as she feels betrayed by such lies. Minerva pleads not to leave; she merely wanted to talk with Diana. Myndi comforts her, but Diana now believes that Julia was right all along. Minerva only was selfish and only cared for herself. She is only interested in exploiting the Amazons. With that, she flies out through the window and she cries out to the gods looking for some sort of sign.</p><p>Later at the Kapatelis house, Vanessa receives a message from Myndi, asking Diana to listen to her, but Vanessa doubts that she will and says that this isn’t a good time to have a talk with Diana as Julia is comforting Diana. Outside, Diana confides in Julia, telling her that she has more questions than ever before. She doesn’t understand why Man’s World is so complicated and asks if she has even taught anything to the people living on this world. Julia replies by telling her that time is what this place needs to understand her, but Diana is still upset as time is very limited on her watch.</p><p>During night, at Minerva’s plant, Chuma kneels by the plant, chanting and plucking berries off it and crushing them. In her room, Minerva prepares herself for the battle ahead, painting her face and contemplating on having the lasso. Chuma has the elixir ready and she gulps it down in one go. The elixir starts taking effect and the ceremonial skin she was wearing is one with her. Her voice becomes a growl, and her eyes are shiny black now with teeth sharpened. She makes her way down the building with her claws and stalks in the shadows.</p><p>At the apartment of Etta Candy, she receives a phone call from Steve Trevor and in the background, the news of a murder is reported, a man named Tamsyn McConnell, but Etta is unaware of this as she continues talking with Steve. Steve tells Etta that he won’t be coming home because he has received a letter telling him that his father is dying. Etta passes on her sympathies.</p><p>At the Kapatelis home, Vanessa is trying to look for Diana and she asks her mother if she has seen her. Vanessa is worried why Diana is out so late in the woods and Julia replies that she is just communing with nature. She adds that Diana will be come inside when she is ready as she is one to take care of herself. Suddenly, Julia notices something out the window, something like an animal. But she doesn’t worry about it, as it probably has something do with Diana.</p><p>Nearby a lake, Wonder Woman sits by a tree, patting a racoon and above the tree, something rustles. The Cheetah is above, studying her target, and below, the racoon darts away, something obviously wrong and before Wonder Woman can react, a tail comes down around her neck choking her and flings her into a tree as it breaks in half. Cheetah knows from that that Wonder Woman is strong, and that she must finish her enemy quickly. Wonder Woman realises that she is against a big cat and before she can defend herself, Cheetah brings out her claws and swipes it across her body. Wonder Woman cries in pain and just avoids a second swipe from Cheetah and disappears into the undergrowth. Wonder Woman launches herself into the air and unhooks her lasso, looking for her enemy, but Cheetah attacks once again kicking her in the back. Wonder Woman is so surprised that a human can move like this. Cheetah dives onto her with Wonder Woman frantically trying to keep those claws away and she realises that she needs to fight back before her eyes are scratched out. Wonder Woman punches her and the Cheetah flies back. She stands her ground for a moment but then darts back into the bushes.</p><p>Wonder Woman gets up with blood coming from the claw marks, however Wonder Woman is the Goddess of Hunt, increasing her awareness around her and she listens for a second heart beat. She hears it, and throws her lasso towards the bushes dragging Cheetah out. At first it seems if Cheetah is succumbing, but then she pulls Wonder Woman towards her. She cannot believe this as she digs her heels into the ground. Cheetah then charges at Wonder Woman and sends her crashing into another tree. The trunk topples over Wonder Woman, and trapped, Cheetah leaps for the kill but then Julia shoots Cheetah in mid-air. Wonder Woman cries out “No!” as she races towards the lake, where Cheetah had fallen into. Wonder Woman asks why she shot Cheetah, and Julia replies that she would have killed her if she hadn’t had shot her. She pulls her lasso out with no Cheetah on the end of it. She dives into the water looking for her, but there is no sign of her. She climbs out of the lake, as Vanessa comes out to see what is happening. Wonder Woman tells Julia that she has lost Cheetah and that the ""she-beast in that ebony deep.""</p><p>Many days later Myndi Mayer is in the gym and receives a phone call from her assistant telling her that Wonder Woman is heading home and she cannot believe it. There was the contract and the tours!</p><p>Meanwhile, Julia, Vanessa and Wonder Woman prepare to say their goodbyes. Wonder Woman tells her that her Amazons need to go back home, she regrets having to leave and that Man’s World has become her second home. Vanessa tells her that Wonder Woman has become her sister but Wonder Woman tells her that she needs to stay strong and look after her mother. Wonder Woman turns her to Julia and she tells her to take care of herself. Wonder Woman explains why she didn’t understand why the gods led her to Julia, but now she sees as Julia is a wise woman. Wonder Woman owes her time to Julia, as she has showed her so much and hug each other. Julia then hands a bag over to Wonder Woman containing some souvenirs of Man’s World during her stay. In the bag are some photo clippings of Vanessa and Julia and Wonder Woman thanks her. Wonder Woman lifts herself up in the air and does the Amazon salute, the “X” formed by crossing her arms with her bracelets touching. Sobbing, Julia and Vanessa watch their friend disappear before their eyes.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""Thanks to Bob Smith""</li><li>First post-Crisis appearance of the Cheetah.</li><li>First letter column titled ""<em>Postscripts to Paradise</em>.""

Eos notices this and tells Dionysus, saying that Pan is rarely this joyful. Dionysus replies that he has been this way ever since Princess Diana stopped Ares from creating chaos. He believes that Pan is to become Zeus’ advisor to all matters Amazon, which troubles him.</p><p>Pan approaches Zeus and asks if he considers the conversation that they had earlier and he thinks Pan is right as he surveys the island below him. He watches Diana as she riding through the island on a horse with her friend Euboea. She is definitely a special one as she has defeated Ares and Pan says that she deserves his <em>special</em> favour as Zeus’ own son, Heracles once favoured Princess Diana’s mother, Hippolyta. Just then, Apollo interrupts and suggests that he does not do what he is about to do, as Hera and the other goddesses have other plans installed for them and doubts that they will take kindly to Zeus’ wants. Zeus disagrees however, as Diana has accomplished her mission. Hestia and Artemis hear the conversation through a special mirror and it confirms their fears: he wants to make the Amazons his playthings. Artemis, angry, rushes off to speak with Athena and Hera. One thing that’s for sure is that Paradise Island will not be made into a brothel.</p><p>On the beach of Paradise Island, Princess Diana tells Euboea how glad she is to be home. Euboea asks to tell her more about Man’s World and what she misses most about it. Diana replies that she misses her friends most and Vanessa even made a necklace for her in a bag they packed for her. They are so different yet have so many things in common, and she has much to learn from them. At the Hall of Justice, the Council of Justice has finished reviewing the items that Diana brought back and now must make a decision. Mnemosyne asks the council whether they should show these items to the Amazons. Philippus says no and Acantha agrees, adding that from the translations from the book Diana has brought with her, little has changed over the years and if what they say about the fate of their centuries lost sister Amazon is true… Philippus snaps back, saying that that is false and Man has always lied to them. She wants nothing to do with them as their weapons have once destroyed them. But Acantha asks if these things are apart of Princess Diana’s destiny? She holds up the American banner and says that they have seen this before. Are the Amazons somehow tied to this coat of arms through the Princess? Hippolyta finally speaks saying that she wore these when she battled Ares doesn’t mean a thing. This banner means nothing now, as she belongs to Paradise Island. Elsewhere, the oracle, Menalippe fears otherwise. For days she has sensed danger, but has said nothing. She wants to tell, but how can she, when the source of the danger is what she has always believed in?</p><p>At the shores of Paradise Island where Diana and Euboea are speaking, Diana hears a loud and deep voice. She recognises this voice as Zeus and wonders what he wants. In the city, they hear of Zeus’ voice and Philippus is uneasy about this and Hippolyta agrees, hearing something uneasy in Zeus’ tone. Zeus tells Diana that she has earned a special gift and is to visit Mount Olympus but Euboea warns her, to be careful of Zeus’ intentions. Diana asks her not to worry. Zeus greets her and she has been chosen to take part in Godhood. Down below, the Amazons cannot believe what they are hearing. Hippolyta knows those words all too well, as Heracles had once said that to her. She orders her horse to be fetched and fears the fate that awaits her daughter.</p><p>In the sky, Diana does not understand, as she already worships him? He agrees, but now it is time for communion of the flesh. During her time in Man’s World, Diana learned that such decisions should be mutual and that she cannot surrender her virginity which she alone must choose without the feelings of desire and commitment. But Zeus is angry with her words and bellows that she has dared defy him and therefore must be punished. Zeus forces himself upon Diana and she pleads him not to do so. She lives to serve him, not to be his toy. Zeus is then interrupted by Hippolyta who tells him to release her daughter immediately. Hippolyta tells her of his son which showed her the same “respect”. He stole her virginity and will not allow it to happen to her daughter. Zeus raises his hand to release a bolt of thunder when he suddenly pushed back to Mount Olympus by Hera, his wife. He disappears and roars that she will pay for this. Diana falls to the ground as Euboea checks on her while her mother rides over to where she lays. Euboea cannot believe what Hippolyta said to Zeus but she must do what a mother must do. Diana fears that she has doomed the Amazons by resisting his orders.</p><p>Later that afternoon in the Temple of Oracle, Hippolyta asks Menalippe if there is any sign and so far, there hasn’t, which is good. Diana says to her mother that she is confused and perhaps it was her destiny to give into them. “Never,” replies her mother. This was against their teachings from the goddesses themselves. Suddenly, the Oracle’s cauldron boils and they are waiting for a reply. Diana says she can hear them in her head and she readies herself as the shaft of light brings her beyond the clouds, even though Hippolyta argues. Hippolyta does not understand and it makes her want to scream as her daughter is taken away from her again. Diana arrives on Mount Olympus and finds all the gods and goddesses waiting for her. Hera says that this can be resolved without shouting, and the goddesses do truly speak of Diana, who is indeed a unique creation. It’s easy to see why Zeus’ eyes wandered… again. Artemis reminds Zeus that he has agreed to allow the Amazon to prove herself as they are not ordinary mortals, but Zeus replies that just because they are immortal does not make them gods! Diana says that she meant no disrespect and the other goddesses tell her that there is nothing to fear. They are merely seeing if she can prove her worth and they will finally know the true destiny of Diana. Zeus then waves his hand to show what she is up against, and to her horror there is a gateway to a demon lair beneath the island. She knows that many Amazons have died because of that portal. If Diana can overcome these demons, she is truly considered equal to the gods. Pan complains that this is a waste of warm flesh, who is then repressed by his father Hermes. Zeus tells her that her journey will unfold each time she completes a challenge set by each god, until all of Olympus is satisfied. At the end of this task, Zeus’ greatest treasure awaits her and she must bring it back. If she loses, the Amazons themselves will also disappear though if she succeeds, Themyscira will prosper. Diana accepts and with a whisk of his hand, she is teleported to Themyscira to prepare for the challenge ahead.</p><p>In the Royal Chamber, Hippolyta tells her fellow sisters that this is very unfair. If it should be a challenge, it should be <em>her</em> challenge, as she was the one who allowed the Amazons to retreat to this island. Diana sees more than just a challenge though, stating that she can reveal her true destiny. Hippolyta asks her how they will truly feel when the goddesses who created them surrender to Zeus’ every desire. She also says that sometimes she feels that they are merely pawns in some game.</p><p>Midnight has come and Diana, Philippus and Euboea ride out to the woods and Philippus is worried for her, asking if she has sufficient armour and if she wants to bring her horse, but Diana refuses, saying that she will harm no other innocents. She wishes her mother had come with her, that their last parting will not be the final memory of each other. She thanks her two sisters for coming with her, but she must complete this challenge on her own. She steps towards two massive metal doors. Diana must use brute force as there are no hinges on the metal doors and it has not been opened since the tragic death of the woman whose name she bears. Finally, the gate opens and a blast of cold wind comes through and she enters quickly as she knows that the evil can escape if she is too slow. Inside, a faint light is glowing and walks down a flight of stairs. As she makes her way down, she realises a cartridge which she picks up. She has seen these on Man’s World before and she wonders how it got here in the first place. Suddenly, a hand grabs her angle from below and whispering voices hiss that it is Cottus, last of the Hecatoncheires. She has dared place her feet on his spine and is suddenly grabbed by many other hands. She struggles as she sinks and Cottus plans to escape as Diana has weakened the door. Just when all seems lost, Diana burst out and Cottus cannot believe what happened. She will not allow anything to get in her way nor will she allow anything to escape. Diana throws her spear towards the thumping sound, which must have been the heart as Cottus roars and she lifts her axe, bringing it down on his spine. The spine shatters and the rest of the creature follows plunging Diana into pitch black. Diana surveys the spear and hopes this will serve as a memorial for all her sisters slain by this creature. Diana smells brimstone and follows the smell, but she is faced with crossing a sea of molten rock. She flies up above it and suddenly, a blast of fire shoots straight up which she just misses. She has heard of this demon before and even Man’s World knows this creature, but on Paradise Island, this creature is <em>real</em>.

Zeus does not believe that she will succeed and Pan agrees. Once again, he is told to quiet down by his father Hermes and Hera, who says that he must have faith in her. Aphrodite is upset that her use of love and beauty put into Diana is now wasted but Athena tells her that beauty of the soul can be a great weapon if not corrupted. Dionysus also adds that he will gain his support if she succeeds in these challenges. </p><p>Elsewhere, Artemis tells Apollo that she fears for Diana and is enraged that Zeus will agree to Pan’s vile suggestions and defile the Amazons.</p><p>Down below, Wonder Woman is battling the Hydra and uses her shield to block its fiery breath. She knows the legend of the Hydra, that cutting off its heads will be no use – it’ll just grow them back! Although Hermes’ trait of granting her speed has worked so far for her, she knows that it’ll be only a matter of time before she becomes incinerated. Finally, the Hydra manages to hit Wonder Woman and she falls backwards, plummeting downwards. Luckily, it is only volcanic ash. She gets up and realises that she must rethink her strategy if she is to win. She can see a portal which is perhaps the path to her next challenge and she has to distract the beast long enough so she can get through. She notices that there are massive columns supporting the cavern and at full speed, she smashes the column with the axe she was provided with. The cavern starts falling apart and the Hydra is stunned for a moment and is pinned by the debris. Wonder Woman unhooks her lasso and ties its heads together. She then ties the end of the lasso onto a rocky outcrop. With its underbelly exposed, she shoots three arrows from her bow and hits its heart directly. It is consumed by the surrounded flames and Wonder Woman rushes to get her lasso. She struggles to untie her lasso as the Hydra turns violently, sending Wonder Woman through the air and onto the cavern floor, shattering her armour. She lies there; maybe unconscious as the god Morpheus looks on and tells Eros that the Amazon Princess should sleep for a while to heal her wounds. But sleep is only temporary, but too much can kill her. He challenges her to free herself from the temptation of Morpheus’ “bliss”.</p><p>Meanwhile in Oklahoma, Steve and Etta arrive on a commercial jet liner and are greeted by Steve’s cousin Doug Aanonson who informs Steve of his father’s death. Steve is glad Etta had accompanied him because he feels very alone right now.</p><p>On Paradise Island, Hippolyta wanders through the palace. She has spent her whole life putting her faith in the gods, and now she fears that her blind faith may be more than she can bear. She wonders why they bless her with a daughter if she continually took them away. There has been a rumour that Heracles was under a mad spell when he ravished Hippolyta and her sisters and maybe this was controlling Zeus? She then feels something cold in her heart and turns to see a vulture. There are no vultures on Paradise Island. The vulture stares straight through her and touches Hippolyta’s mind and soul and her prayers become clear. She removes her crown and it is time for her to surrender to the mother in <em>her</em>. Some minutes later, a guard calls for Menalippe as she fears the queen has gone mad. From what she is wearing, Menalippe knows that that is Hippolyta. She calls Philippus and her soldiers before the queen does something stupid.</p><p>Outside the Cavern of Doom, evil can be seen escaping from the broken seal where Wonder Woman is trying to escape. She desperately wants to sleep but she knows that she has to continue her challenge. She stands up to her and feet and makes her way to the next challenge as the Hydra is dead now. But there are two portals and all her weapons and armour was destroyed in the battle with the Hydra and only has her lasso left. She has no choice but to try each tunnel and prays her lasso will help her. She tries to concentrate though sounds of wailing start, filling her ears. She uses to her hands to cover her ears and cannot stop it as her fear induces it. The portal suddenly is filled with her fallen Amazon sisters crying out. They beg her to save them and reach out for Diana. She cannot tell if this is real or not, but she cannot stand by and watch this. She must help! She prays for help from Athena and then a vision of Julia Kapatelis appears trapped in a giant web. As Wonder Woman reaches out to help her, Julia Kapatelis turns into Echidna, a She-Serpent. She wraps herself around the surprised Wonder Woman and raises her axe, preparing to attack.</p><p>Outside Doom’s Doorway, Hippolyta arrives as the vulture sits on a tree branch and watches. Just then, Philippus tackles her, pleading with her not to go in there. Hippolyta responds by saying that she must go in there. She cannot explain why, but she knows her daughter needs her. Just as Philippus is about to attack Hippolyta, the vulture swoops down and attacks her. Hippolyta then attacks Philippus as well, but she manages to throw her over her shoulder. Philippus asks if this is all worth it, and Hippolyta replies that a mother must do what a mother must do and Philippus hurls her into a nearby tree. As she chargers her, Hippolyta hits her with a kick. Both of them are warriors, and this can only end in two ways – victory… or death. The vulture watches on and Hippolyta knows that she must leave her opponent unconscious before she can move on, and with that, she slams her fist into Philippus’ face with tears in her eyes. Hippolyta then puts Philippus on her horse and bid farewell to her, and whispers that when she remembers Hippolyta, she will remember her as a good queen. With that, she sends the horse and Philippus back to Themyscira. Hippolyta then picks up her helmet and is watched by the vulture and Pan. He curses the queen, afraid that his truth may be revealed.</p><p>Inside the Cavern of Doom, Wonder Woman struggles as she dodges the serpent’s strikes while trying to keep its tail away with its poisonous sting. As the creature strikes with her axe, she blocks it with her bracelets, shattering the axe. Wonder Woman then grabs the serpent’s tail and swings her around before slamming her into the wall. A swarm of demons distract her as she sees the next portal. But could this be the next true portal or just another trap? She is then grabbed by the serpent, telling her that the portal is not for her. Wonder Woman, thinking that that reason is good enough for her to go through, punches the serpent and sends her sailing. The Amazons flies through the portal and is now in a stormy sky where she just misses a plane that flies by her. She then realises that this is Steve Trevor’s plane and this was the day in which she rescued him. She then hears a voice that says ""Boreas greets thee as my obedient winds sweep away the great mystery that impedes thy quest for fulfilment!"" She the loses control and plunges into the ocean, but she can still breathe and makes her way to the ocean floor and sees a plane wreck. Could it be Steve’s jet? Next, Poseidon appears and says that she must have faith. A light surrounds her and she walks over to the plane wreckage. Is this the gods’ way of telling her that she has a special connection with Steve? As she moves closer to the plane, she realises that this is an older model. Suddenly, a woman’s voice calls to her and there stands a rocky figure and that she has been waiting a long time for Diana’s arrival. The light is blinding Diana from seeing who it is, but then it slowly fades and she is a blonde woman with Amazon armour and looks down upon her and tells her that she is warrior in which Diana was named after. If she likes, the Amazon Princess can call her… Diana!</p>",,,,,,,False,28895,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/26011-3824-28895-1-wonder-woman.jpg',

happened to Cottus. Suddenly, a number of demons fly towards her and she cuts them down with her sword. She is obviously outnumbered and the vulture cannot do anything for her except guide her. She has come prepared for this journey she undertakes, so she brings out a little bottle of oil and fills the bowl of her shield. She then uses a stone and flint and with that, she ignites a spark. A fire starts burning and the demons fly away from the fire but not before Hippolyta hurls the flaming shield, sending the demons to their fiery death.</p><p>In Oklahoma at the home of Steve’s aunt and uncle, Steve sits besides his dead father and apologises for not being here sooner. There is so much that he wanted to say as Steve’s father was a good man. After Steve’s mother died, his father took on the role of parenting and he was the best soldier. He takes his father’s hand and he hopes that he will understand his decision to retire. Downstairs, Etta and Edna Aanonson are looking at photos of Steve’s mother. Steve’s aunt explains that she was lost 40 years ago and Etta comments that Steve never really talked about his mother. She asks Edna what her name was, and she replies “Diana.”</p><p>“Diana!” Wonder Woman says, shocked. The woman standing above her confirms that the Amazon Princess was named after her, the mysterious woman that her Amazon sisters would never speak of. She takes off her helmet and says that she has been waiting for this day for a long time. It was time the Amazon Princess learned her heritage. Wonder Woman asks what the Challenge of the Gods is, and Diana replies that it is a way of learning about one’s self and suggests that Wonder Woman sit down because they have a lot to talk about. She says that she was born Diana Rockwell in Omaha, Nebraska and that they have a lot in common – they are both independent and both love flying. Then she married and was then named Mrs. Lt. Ulysses Stephen Trevor. Wonder Woman’s awareness pricks up as Diana says “Trevor”. Diana continues, as she says that she gave birth to her son, Stephen. Wonder Woman then realises that the Steve Trevor that she met is Diana’s son. Diana explains to Wonder Woman that Ares was a pawn of the Fates and by using Steve as a pawn; he affirmed the connection with Amazon Princess. She then joined the Woman's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron. With both of his parents in the Air Force, Steve stayed with Ulysses' sister's family though Diana always wrote to Steve. In August 1945, the family was reunited as the war had ended. After the war, Diana had promised to become the wife and mother but for Ulysses, it was not enough.</p><p>In the Cavern of Doom, Pan sits on a rock looking at the slain corpse of the Hydra. He plucked the Hydra’s teeth and planted it in the ground. Hippolyta is not far from Wonder Woman as she finds two portals. The vulture guides her through the right portal and then she suddenly hears music… the music of Pan’s pipes. Suddenly, the ground around her erupts and skeletal hands appear from the ground and she finds herself surrounded by three skeletons armed with swords and shields.</p><p>In the Aanonson home, arrangements for the funeral have been made and they sit on the couch looking through old photo albums. There is one picture where Diana is seen wearing her flying jacket, with different patches and W.A.F.S. insignia. This was the last thing Steve saw her in.</p><p>Meanwhile, Diana continues telling story, saying that being a pilot means making sacrifices and she feels her son made too much of them. She told Steve that she will miss his birthday, but will be home for Christmas. The Air Force was waiting for the new Sabre jet and Diana was dying to fly the jet. When she kissed Steve, he didn’t kiss her back and to this day, she wonders how he knew. She tried to forget Steve’s sadness by burying herself in work. When flying the jet one day she found herself in the worse lightning storm. Her instruments went crazy and her wing was struck by thunder. She ejected herself away from the flaming plane, but the strong wings just pushed her back and both of them fell into the sea. She was unconscious and could swear that a god was holding her in his hands.</p><p>The Amazon queen, battling the skeletons manages to break one, and goes for the next. With their blazing swords, they attack Hippolyta and hit her shield. It falls apart and she falls over a ledge, holding on to it for dear life. She cuts a skeleton’s leg and it falls over. She climbs back up, and the last skeleton charges at her, and at the right moment, Hippolyta strikes it with her sword and it shatters to pieces. Though dead, its flaming sword manages to hit Hippolyta’s left shoulder and she faces the two portals, wondering which one to take. As she goes near the two portals, she experiences the wailing sounds in which her daughter experienced. The vulture swoops forward and begins to speak the language of the Pillar of Pallor and the vulture understands the Pillar’s pain. With that comes peace and leads Hippolyta into the left portal. Pan curses at Hippolyta’s correct choice, but surely, she will perish without her daughter’s help!</p><p>Diana continues to tell her story. When she had regain consciousness she found herself on a shore of an island. In the distance, she could hear female voices shouting and took out her firearm. She then headed out towards the shouting and there was a Greek column and beyond that was an entrance to the cavern. She stepped into the darkness and suddenly she wished she hadn’t. In front of her were a group of women who were fighting against a multi-handed monster who had escaped through Doom’s Doorways. Later on, she learned its name was Cottus. Apparently, Cottus had broken out during a ritual which was conducted by Menalippe in which the creature had a hold on her. Philippus tried to save her but she was struck down by one of Cottus’ many arms. Without hesitation, Diana fired upon Cottus. Cottus decided to retreat and took Menalippe with him. Philippus ordered her soldiers to prepare to seal the gates while she goes in after her and Diana followed. Philppus was swatted away like a fly, and Diana was still firing at Cottus who then grabbed her and she could see Cottus’ two crimson eyes staring at her and with her last ounce of strength, she fired her bullet in between the eyes of Cottus.</p><p>At the same time Diana was telling Wonder Woman her story, Steve and Etta were on the porch and he tells Etta how he will never forget the day before Christmas where he saw his father’s face. Steve would never see his mother ever again.</p><p>In the cavern, Diana explains how it was pretty much blur after that and she can remember telling her name to someone who was holding her in their arms, and then she died. Wonder Woman is surprised by such an abrupt ending. “She died child,” says Hades. He tells her that the people who have wasted their lives only need to fear for him and he the brave, wise and innocent should not fear him. Hades continues Diana’s story. Since Diana Trevor died in service to the Amazons, Hippolyta gave her a warrior’s funeral. Battle armour and a coat of arms were forged and the tattered remains of Diana’s jacket were fashioned and sealed. The weapon that Diana also held was also sealed in a place of honour until the weapon could be used to determine one worthy to wear Diana Rockwell’s mantle. And now that mantle is worn by Wonder Woman.</p><p>On the other side of the globe, a gun salute is given to Ulysses Trevor's as his coffin is lowered and Steve and Etta give one final salute. Hades tells Diana that it is time for her to join someone who is waiting at the Elysian Fields and replies that she has been waiting for this moment. She says her goodbye to Wonder Woman hoping that the knowledge she has given will help her along the way. She has placed all her faith in the woman who bears her name and others who bear her name… Stephen Rockwell Trevor. As Steve and Etta watch the coffin descend he remembers something that he told his father. It was the night before his mother disappeared. At the time he thought it was a dream but he had a vision of his mother standing over him, comforting him. His father says that she will always watch over, and now he guesses that both of them will.</p><p>Hades holds out his hand and Diana takes it and tells Wonder Woman that she is the representation of two worlds and the Amazon heritage is what her destiny is built on. The future should always resonate with the echoes of the past, and may Athena’s wisdom guide her! As Steve lays a flower on his mother’s grave which is next to his father’s and Diana follows Hades into the Underworld but just before they disappear, Diana turns around and asks Wonder Woman to take good care of his son. Wonder Woman flies back through the cavern and she feels that much has changed since her meeting with Diana. She understands her bond with Steve now, but does not know Zeus’ plans. She goes deeper in the cavern and hears Pan’s flute and sees him sitting on top of a rock outcrop. He tells her that her next challenge will put her in conflict with the gods. She will travel to the Green Lanterns to confer with the Guardians of the Universe. There is her next challenge – to help in the birthing of an immortal man and but warns her that the danger lurks in a form of the Manhunters. Diana agrees to take the challenge and a portal opens.</p><p>Elsewhere in the cavern, Hippolyta has arrived at the ruined temple and the vulture has flown away. She sees a strange rock formation and stairs that lead down somewhere. Suddenly she hears the flapping of wings. It is not her vulture guide but Harpies. She is outnumbered and once again, she is forced over the ledge. She falls through the darkness but uses her axe to dig into the rock stopping her from falling. But as her axe hits the rock, she hears a cry of pain from it… she realises that this massive stone is in fact Heracles!</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""Read this week's issue of Millennium

For centuries he has hated him but years on Paradise Island has taught her the lack of foresight of such anger. Hippolyta wonders what he has done to deserve this kind of punishment. Though his skin is made of stone, the harpies’ talons claw into him though she cannot be sympathetic for him right now, as she has to find her daughter.</p><p>Up in Mount Olympus, Zeus can see what is happening, and is enraged that he can see the dead body of Pan. Hermes asks if Pan has been dead for so long, then who has been living amongst them as Pan? Zeus wants this impostor to pay for what he has done, but Hera points her finger at Zeus, accusing him of taking part in this. Hera believes that his arrogance has caused nothing but trouble for the gods and it is time for him to pay. She now knows that Gaea’s destiny must be fulfilled by the Amazons, and she will not allow him to destroy it. The false Pan has led Diana to believe that accepting the challenge and she orders Hermes to bring back the Amazon Princess at once. Hermes makes his way through the void between the two worlds, trying to accept the fact that his son is dead. He arrives at the Green Lantern Corps headquarters, where they are discussing the promised Millennium. Wonder Woman is in a conversation when light surrounds her and then she sees Hermes appear in front of her and asks her to come back with him. Diana asks about the challenge and Hermes replies that she has been tricked by a fake Pan. It was not Pan at all but an agent of a Manhunter who was sure he could destroy her. By doing this, he has succeeded in putting Mankind into even more danger. Hermes tells her that her mother has also gone into the Cavern of Doom to help her, but she cannot complete the ultimate labour, only Diana can. They both vanish and the heroes around her wonder where she has gone. Even though they need every hero that they can get, they understand that she leaves with good reason. Zeus and the other gods watch as Hermes and Diana travel through the void, and Zeus can now see that she is surely the one to stop this madness. The false Pan knew that and used him and he hopes that his arrogance has not doomed them all.</p><p>Inside the Cavern of Doom, the Cyclops’ club strikes down at Hippolyta. She dodges, only dodging it with mere inches. The Cyclops is hungry and he grabs Hippolyta and lifts her towards his face. She tells him to unhand her. As he opens his mouth to consume her, he is suddenly hit by a powerful punch as Wonder Woman comes in. The Cyclops lets go of Hippolyta and Diana goes to check on her mother and tells her that they will talk, but they have to finish this off first. The Cyclops gets to his feet and he thrashes the cave around but then he realises that his actions may bring down this whole cavern. Diana unhooks her lasso and binds the Cyclops to a column and he is then compelled to tell the truth. When he was banished to the Cavern of Doom, they fought and ate each other, as that was the only way to survive and that was God’s cruelest joke as his good must literally bump into him so that he can hunt. When the dead body of a Man-goat dropped down at his feet, he ate it and that has given him eternal indigestion. As she starts sobbing, he prays that she will slay him, out of compassion. Diana asks her mother what to do as the Amazons cannot simply kill someone so helpless. But Hippolyta does not answer and is staring at the statue. She asks Diana if she can hear that, and Diana replies that she cannot. She stares at the distant form of Heracles and says that she cannot allow someone to suffer like that, even though he has caused so much pain for her over these years. Hippolyta races up the base of the statue and she thinks to herself that she was brought here for this task. Suddenly, she is struck down by a fiery blast. Diana runs towards her mother and Hippolyta is rolling in the dust to put out the flames. Before Diana can reach her mother, she too is hit by a fiery blast. Hippolyta cries out for her daughter, but she is then choked by the Minotaur. Behind him stands the Chimera and Echidna, the snake demons. The Minotaur tells her that Heracles will die by the harpies, as they slash his skin and that the both of them will die. When the flesh of Heracles is finally pierced, the evil from below this island will finally be revealed. A voice then asks him ""Is this then Zeus' greatest Treasure?"" and before the Minotaur can turn around, Diana punches the Minotaur. She puts the Minotaur into a headlock and both of them struggle and as she tells him that she cannot let Heracles suffer anymore. Diana then throws the Minotaur over her shoulders and slams him into the ground. Chimera launches his fiery breath and Diana just manages to dodge it. Chimera is amazed, but Echidna reassures him that she cannot escape serpentine coils. She wraps her tail around Diana, choking her like a python, but Echidna hears a voice behind her telling her to stop at once, and it is Hippolyta who beheads Echidna.</p><p>The Minotaur gets up and retaliates by taking down Hippolyta from behind but before he can move in for the kill, Diana grabs him by the horns and hurls him across the cavern. He prepares to advance on Diana when a large hand scoops him up and the Cyclops is happy to find food once again. This confuses Diana as that means he has escaped from the lasso and the Minotaur smashes the jaw of the Cyclops, letting it fall to the ground shaking the whole cavern and the ground under them begin to shake, and the Cyclops and Minotaur fall into eternal darkness. Diana looks down and is glad that the fates have granted Cyclops’ wish. Diana runs over to the mother as she asks for Diana’s to forgive her for ruining everything. Diana replies that she was right, and she found what she was <em>meant</em> to find. She just wishes she knew how the Cyclops escaped from the lasso. Just then, a woman’s voice replies ""Why, with my assistance of course"" and they turn to see a woman. She tells Diana that she recognises her as the mad woman, and Hippolyta as the vulture. She reveals her true identity as Harmonia daughter of Ares. She tells her that Ares has known this place since its creation but he saw no reason to interfere with the fake Pan’s plan and now that Diana has calmed down the madness in him and has prepared him to see what is rightfully his. She holds up the Talisman which Diana uses during the Ares Assault and that she is the only one that can capture the demons once and for all and deliver them to its new host – Ares! If Diana can untie this knot, then she is truly the chosen one of Gaea. Harmonia leaves giving Diana’s lasso and Talisman back and she wonders how she can destroy the demons without killing Heracles. She sees why Harmonia brought her mother down here and sees that perhaps Heracles can be saved by their forgiveness. She picks her mother up and flies to the top where she chases away Chimera and the Harpies.</p><p>In Olympus, Aphrodite is watching and wonders how she can face these demons without any help. Athena replies that by answer <em>her</em> own challenge, she can allow Diana’s beauty of her soul to be her shield. She will only survive if this clay statue is one with Gaea, only if she is truly all that is of woman.</p><p>In the Cavern of Doom, Hippolyta can hear the painful moans of Heracles, but Diana tells her to be brave. This must be some kind of connection between the two of them if she can hear him. Diana gives her lasso to her mother and binds her mother to the side of Heracles’ head and then flies back still holding the lasso. Hippolyta’s and Heracles’ minds are filled with visions of each other, and suddenly, they see new images and viewpoints as they both suffer for each other. Hippolyta sheds a tear as she calls out to her long lost sister Antiope and for the first time, their two souls releasing. Heracles’ flesh begins to blister and crack and the harpies and Chimera fly away. Suddenly, a light bursts out from Heracles. Nightmares imprisoned inside of Heracles are finally released and she gives chase to a trail of demons who try to head for the exit because if the demonic horde is not stopped, no one will survive. She hopes that she has made the right decision. She is racing against the demonic horde and up ahead she can see the doorway open. She stops her way between the doorway and readies herself for what is about to come. She holds her amulet up as the demonic horde strikes it straight in the middle. Diana can feel so much power as she struggles to keep it down and trembles ride across Paradise Island and the Amazons wonder if immortality is at an end.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rock beneath Hippolyta’s feet begins to collapse and she begins falling, but a hand grabs her hand. She looks up and it is Heracles. Seismographic stations across the world are off the scales. Diana does not let go of the amulet, as it starts to burn her hands and all that power sends Diana into another realm. She finds herself in Areopagus, the desolate home of Ares. He greets her, and thanks her for putting the power all into the amulet for him. Ares asks her to give it to him, but she refuses as such power is not for him. He tells her that she is granted wisdom from Athena and that she should use it. Her heart tells her to give the talisman to him, so she lets go and it flies into his hands. Blinding light surrounds Ares and the demons are released into his home. Now the ultimate power of destruction is finally his as he ascends towards the sky, laughing his evil laugh.</p><p>Diana looks on in horror wondering what she has done but she Harmona’s voice, reassuring her that she has done right. Harmonia also tells her that she done has finished her mission and she is one of the greatest warriors to exist so far. There will always be new challenges, however, and the consequences from today will shape her future and that nothing happens merely by accident. Harmonia passes on her blessing and the gratitude of the gods before disappearing. Diana is left alone but Hermes appears and Diana begs him to return her mother back to her. He says that he cannot and there is one more challenge, and that is <em>his</em> challenge. Diana is confused as Harmonia tells her that it is over but Hermes responds that her next challenge is to return to Man’s World to avenge the death of his son. She must find the Manhunter who impersonated him and kill him!</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""Read this week's issue of Millennium before reading this

href=""https://comicvine.gamespot.com/millennium/4050-4011/"" data-ref-id=""4050-4011""><em>Millennium</em></a>” crossover. In issue #7, Wonder Woman confronts the Manhunter who posed as Pan. As they confront each other, Wonder Woman throws her lasso around the Manhunter. He says that if she were to stop him escaping, she would have to kill him. Wonder Woman then tightens the lasso around his waste and cuts his torso and rips in half. She is horrified in what she has done, though her friends tell her that the Manhunter was an android. With Hermes’ challenge completed, he teleports Wonder Woman to her mother in the Cavern of Doom and rescues her.*</p><p>Wonder Woman wonders how many senseless slaughters have occurred due to her challenges. She has completed Hermes’ challenge and she is on her way to rescue her mother. She only hopes that she is still alive, even though she is badly wounded. When she arrives at the Cavern of Doom, he finds Hercules in the form of a human in flesh and he holds the whole of Paradise Island on his back while Hippolyta lays unconscious near his feet. Heracles tells Wonder Woman that it is not safe here and that she should go, but Wonder Woman replies that her place is <i>beside</i> her mother. Hercules then realises that Wonder Woman is Hippolyta’s daughter and he tells her to take her to the ground above as he thinks that he can’t hold up the island any longer. Wonder Woman replies that she had read he was able to lift the heavens himself! He responds that the legends tend to exaggerate and that she must leave now. Just as Wonder Woman is about to leave, a voice says that she does not need to. Zeus and the other gods appear before them. Zeus apologises for his arrogance, and despite all this, the Amazons forgive the ones who have abused and exploited them. Through them, the glory of Gaea has been restored as Diana and Hippolyta have shown mercy as well as strength and courage. They have proven themselves as the true representatives of the Amazons. Diana therefore has completed all her challenges and the goddesses break the Amazons’ penance.</p><p>The Gods instruct Wonder Woman and Hercules to go now, as Gaea can hold up this up now. Wonder Woman holds Hercules in her arms and flies towards the exit. Meanwhile, the Amazons are running in fear as the earth trembles near the gateway to the Cavern of Doom. Light comes from the gateway and the Amazons fear that evil will escape from the Cavern of Doom, but Euboea reassures the Amazons that the light is good and it is just work of the gods. They are then surprised to see Wonder Woman carry Hercules through the door. Hercules greets them but the Amazons fear that the person who had doomed them has returned to do it again, but Wonder Woman assures them that he is a new person and that they must listen to him. Hippolyta is not far behind, and she backs up Wonder Woman’s statements and that they must not let fear and anger undo what they have done. They are not the only ones who have suffered a penance as she asks Hercules to address the Amazon Nation.</p><p>Hercules apologises for causing such pain as he betrayed their trust and really does ask for their forgiveness. There is a moment of silence as Hercules waits for a reply. With a cry of “All hail Hercules!” they swarm forward and hug him, welcoming him back. Euboea rejoices and is happy to say that the ordeal is finally over. Diana hugs her mother, also glad that this is over.</p><p>Up high on Mount Olympus, Zeus and his wife Hera watch this happy moment and she is glad that this has tamed his headstrong son. Zeus agrees and appreciates the patience she has shown. They declare their love for each other, and Aphrodite rushes off to tell everyone, and this is a time of rejoicing and unadulterated lovemaking. Athena adds that this is a time lesson to be learned and to never be weakened again. Artemis agrees but she says that this can wait for tomorrow, now is the time for celebrations. But when they see Hermes sit atop a column looking sad, they must also take the time to spare a moment for Pan. Despite their differences, Pan was always his son. They may take great pleasure in power restored, but there will be challenges that may challenge Olympus.</p><p>In Oklahoma, in the home of Edna and Everett Aanonson, Steve is in the attic looking through some old memorabilia. Etta comes up and tells him that dinner is almost ready. Steve comments on his father’s congressional hearings and how they almost ruined his career. Steve felt he betrayed his father, but he still stayed in the air force as he had his mother’s tenaciousness in him. Etta feels guilty for trying to convince him to stay in the air force and that he has to do what’s right for <i>him</i>. She confesses that she has loved him for a very long time, and their emotions take over as they embrace.</p><p>On the Island of Healing, Hippolyta rests as her wounds are healing. Philippus enters and the Amazon Queen tells her that she looks well and is glad that the battle did not injure her. Philippus replies that the only wound is her heart and promises to never cause her queen such shame. Hippolyta reassures her that she was only doing what the captain of the Amazons should have done and that she could not have asked for anyone better to protect Paradise Island. Since Doom’s Doorway has been destroyed they no longer need to fear for their sisters guarding it.</p><p>Days later at the Coliseum everyone is having a good time and in the centre stands a bier with weapons and armour. Each piece of armour or weapons has been contributed by the Amazons in hoping that they will never need them again. Euboea addresses the crowd, saying that this destruction should be remembered in honour of the Amazons who died guarding the doors which led to evil. In the royal box, Diana asks Hercules if he is enjoying the festivities. He happily replies but he asks how they will survive if they have no army? She replies that on Paradise Island, there is no need for them.</p><p>The following day, Diana flies through the skies gracefully. Below, Hercules and Hippolyta watch the Princess as she flies through the clouds and he tells her that Diana is truly a wonderful person. He tells her that he can see Hippolyta’s spirit in Diana and questions if she is perhaps his own seed? She informs him that she had Diana long before he raped her. Hercules is relieved from this truth as it would have been such a mockery if such a graceful daughter was born from such an act of violation, though time has done nothing to diminish his respect for her. Hippolyta admits that when he first said those words, she knew they were dipped in venom, but now she senses her sincerity. He then takes her hand and tells her and asks her for a kiss of forgiveness. Hiding above the branches is Diana as she watches them kiss for several moments. Hercules prays that someday her memories of his sins can be erased and that she might see the true feelings he feels for her. She agrees with him as she is still a woman and it has been a very long time, but she is still the queen of Themyscira and there is still much to do. She bids him farewell and adds her love for him. Hercules steps back and looks upwards as a shaft of light and asks his father to take him back. He has at last cleaned his plate of sins and with his final farewell, he is gone.</p><p>Days later in the Amazon Senate Chamber, a meeting is taking place. Hellene addresses the chamber and comments that man has set foot on Paradise Island and that she is fearful for doing so. What has Man ever done for the Amazons? Someone replies that Man is now hoping to create peace, but Hellene replies that they are more likely to bring weapons rather than peace. Diana says that it is possible, but how can they create peace if they continue to isolate themselves? A fellow Amazon agrees with Diana, but she also adds that they are treading on thin ice if they do so. Hippolyta then speaks, saying that they have learned much about Man’s World, but she fears that they must learn more. She then asks her daughter to return to Man’s World and learn even more.</p><p>The next morning in the Temple of Hades, Hippolyta waits starring at the closed door which leads to the honoured shrine of an Amazon warrior to perish – she who is also the namesake of Hippolyta’s daughter… Diana Trevor! Wonder Woman stands before the statue, and says that she did not understand what the armour meant, but now she understands and she shall carry on Diana Trevor’s work. There is so much she can learn from Man’s World, and even though she wears the armour, it is a sign of peace and she hopes that she will still be worthy. Diana makes her way towards the exit and is greeted by her mother. Hippolyta asks her if she is ready, but Diana worries for her. The Queen reassures her that she will be okay and that she is not only the daughter of her, but the daughter of the world. When the gods gave her the sandals, which was a sure sign that she was the one. With that, Diana flies to the skies and she travels through the void and emerges over the night sky of Boston. She passes the offices of Myndi Mayer, who is entertaining.</p><p>At the Kapatelis house Vanessa exclaims the light has gone out. She begs her mother, Julia, to see what is wrong and so she climbs upstairs. As Julia steps inside Vanessa’s room, she is shocked and stunned to see her old friend, Diana, standing at the back. Julia is overjoyed as Vanessa reveals her surprise. They hug each other, and Diana tells her that there is much to do. She asks if she can stay for a while, and Julia replies that she would not let her stay anywhere else. “Welcome home Diana, welcome home!”</p>",,,,,,,False,29402,"{'icon_url':

She flies towards the face that is formed and it is Superman. She stares in awe and Superman reaches out with his hand. He holds his hand and he pulls her in closer… Diana wakes up in her bed at the Kapatelis residence. Her dreams of Superman are becoming more and more vivid, as if they were keeping up with the events of the real world. Everywhere she went, she always saw Superman. Surely, she has the trait of wisdom from Athena, but she didn’t understand these new sensations. She wishes Julia was here so she could confide in her, but she is always visiting her family in Greece.</p><p>Elsewhere in Boston City, at the headquarters of Ogawa Electronics, the office is sparse. There is an unconsciousness guard on the floor and a shadowy figure in front of a computer screen. He finds information on Valerie Beaudry, using the access code “Silver Swan”. Down the hallway, the guard is looking for his colleague. The mysterious man prints out what he needs and the guard is approaching. He punches in the access code to enter the room and he slowly steps through the doorway. The stranger than puts a cloth over his mouth and he begins to climb out the window and down the building.</p><p>Across town in Myndi Mayer’s office her team surveys a billboard of Wonder Woman and Myndi nods her approval to Skeeter LaRue. Skeeter hardly acknowledges Deni’s and Steve’s input. Myndi and Skeeter move to the bar to celebrate such work of art. Deni cannot believe that Skeeter takes credit for all of Steve’s ideas. Steve agrees, as Myndi has not bothered listening to him since Skeeter joined him. Steve tells Deni not to worry about it, as it’s not worth worrying over.</p><p>In the Chinatown district, Maxine Sterenbuch, reading a note that her friend Valerie Beaudry sent her, asking her to meet here during the late hour of this night. Then, a car at high speed almost runs her over when she manages to just dive out of the way and it slams into the car booth. She runs down a nearby alley and she realises it’s a dead end, and the car is not far behind. Suddenly, a bullet hits the car’s front tire and the car flies out of control as it slams into the wall. The driver of the car steps out, and aims the weapon at her. Suddenly, a voice distracts him and he fires into the smoke and haze. But he is gunned down himself and the voice emerges from the building and the smoke. Maxine thanks the man, but soon, the man who saved her becomes her killer and everything goes black for her.</p><p>In Massachusetts in Julia’s summer home, Diana stands naked in the moonlight, praying to the gods. She asks the gods if this is a sign, or just an infatuation. She needs help deciding and asks if her mother’s feelings for Hercules are the same as her feelings for Superman and she asks for a sign. Just then, she hears a voice and Vanessa is behind her. Diana apologises for waking her up and Vanessa comments that she sure likes to pray a lot. She assumes that Diana is anxious about the charity event tomorrow, and Vanessa offers herself as moral support. Diana asks her if Vanessa will be bringing her boyfriend along and Vanessa says yes, saying that he is the best!</p><p>Somewhere else in Massachusetts Maxine Sterenbuch awakens with a hurting head. She then realises that she is cuffed to the bed frame. The man who shot her with a dart introduces himself as Solomon Buchman and apologises for the side effects of the dart. The man hands her an envelope, and inside is a picture of Maxine with the word “terminate” stamped over it. That man who tried to kill her didn’t appear by accident, he was hired to kill her! It is not just <em>anyone</em> who wants to kill her, it is her friend Valerie Beaudry, otherwise known as Silver Swan. She tells him that he is crazy and that her friend would never do such a thing. Maxine can’t accept that her friend would attempt to kill her, and she goes on to recount how she always wanted a pen pal at 15. She saw an ad in a teen magazine, and started talking to Valerie and they shared all the same interests. When Maxine turned 16, she sent a picture of Valerie, but Valerie never sent one back. Still, Maxine remained friends with Valerie. Valerie said that their friendship, their <em>love</em> was one of the best, but at 18, Maxine wanted more. She told Valerie to meet her in North Dakota, but Valerie never appeared and she finally learned that Valerie had closed her post box and moved, leaving no forward address. Valerie was a very private person, and Maxine thought that her selfishness has caused Valerie to be pushed away from her.</p><p>Maxine then moved to Boston where she worked at a boutique. Then a few months into her job, the phone rang, and it turned out to be Valerie. She and her boyfriend were in town. Maxine went to the provided address and there she was. Her hair was all silver and her skin so smooth. She was happy to see Valerie, but something was not right, and that was Valerie’s boyfriend, Henry Cobb Armbruster. He was not happy to see her and asked her to leave. Maxine left the house and he heard Henry abusing Valerie. They kept meeting in secret though something had changed in Valerie. Her confidence was lowered. Maxine suggested that she leave him, but she always avoided this subject and she always wished she was beautiful as Wonder Woman. Valerie was always getting new bruises and soon they Valerie had to leave and this is when Maxine got the letter.</p><p>Solomon tells her that the letter was sent to Maxine so she could not learn the truth. Then, he begins to show another photo, a deformed woman and Maxine asks who she is. Solomon replies that it is Valerie. He explains that this photo was taken five years ago when she was the subject of an experiment called “Silver Swan”. According to the records he stole earlier this evening, Valerie had developed the ability to use disruption abilities which Armbruster International intended to use. Solomon then puts in a video tape he had put together from the the explosion of HCA Labs' Alaskan Branch. Solomon watches as an old man appears on the screen, and Soloman says that that is his father. There are images of his father trying to escape the thing he created. His stalker floats through the lab, her feet never touching the floor, when she finally finds him. She screams as inaudible scream, because the soundtrack was ruined, but from the images, it is a destructive scream as his father is reduced to a puddle.</p><p>The sun rises over Boston and Henry is already awake speaking on the phone. He is informed that the hitman he hired is killed and that Maxine is still on the run. He instructs the caller to keep looking, and turns to one of his aides, Mr Choi. He tells Choi that Maxine must have had an accomplice and she knows about the Silver Swan. Choi looks at the poster with Wonder Woman surrounded by little children, smiling, and says that Maxine will not be able to reach their “secret weapon”. He then asks Valerie if she will be able to deal with Wonder Woman and Henry replies that she surely does have a hate for Wonder Woman.</p><p>At Hanscom Air Force base, Steve congratulates Etta on losing 35 pounds. Pleased, Etta replies she has 20 more pounds to go. He jokingly adds that she is turning into Wonder Woman. She looks at a leaflet on the table, and she looks at the cover where Wonder Woman is flying through the air and she has been hearing much about this fare. With Wonder Woman’s face <em>and</em> figure, how will Etta ever compete with her?</p><p>That afternoon, crowds of people go to the charity event. Steve is there and hopes that Wonder Woman still remembers him. He wonders what she wants to talk to him about after the show. She said it was something personal, and she wanted Etta to be there with him. Just then, Vanessa and her friends show up, Etta asks how her mother is doing. Vanessa replies that she is over in Greece. Vanessa then introduces Bobby, and he says that any friend of Diana is a friend of his. He also adds that Diana had told him how much he liked Steve and how much of a father he meant to her. The kids wave goodbye, and one of Vanessa’s friends tell her that Barry only has interest in Wonder Woman and not her. Vanessa spits back that she is only jealous that Barry likes Vanessa and not her.</p><p>On the podium, Skeeter tells Miss Cooney, who is the head of charity that this event is a success. Cooney appreciates such a gesture, but she is afraid that people are only here because of Wonder Woman, and not the fact that there are homeless children. He replies that this event is really about making money. Just then, a woman steps over and advises that Wonder Woman is ready. She turns to the microphone, happy to announce that they are here to welcome an extra special visitor and without further ado, she presents Wonder Woman! Among the crowd are Solomon and Maxine as Wonder Woman flies over the crowd. She cannot believe that even though she is a total stranger, they cheer for her. Just then, a low humming sound can be heard. Solomon whispers that the Silver Swan is here and Maxine asks how he knew she would be here. He replies that she mentioned Valerie was always jealous of Wonder Woman. Then, the crowd disperses as a sonic wave disperses the massive billboard. Wonder Woman looks on in shock as Silver Swan swoops down from above. She introduces herself and says that everyone must obey her, or feel the fury of the swan song.

Wonder Woman moves closer and Silver Swan unleashes her sonic waves. Wonder Woman puts her hands over her ears. She sees her sonic waves strike a nearby Ferris wheel and sends it over.

Wonder Woman flies over and saves it from crashing down. The wheel however is falling apart and she knows that she can’t hold on for much longer. A young boy screams for his life as he is hanging on for his life. One of Vanessa’s friends says he will help, but Steve pushes him aside, saying that this is no place for kids. Steve fortunately catches the child in time. Meanwhile, the police are desperately trying to stop Silver Swan who seems to be dodging their bullets. She emits a low hum and they realise that she has some force field up. Lt. Michael Shands radios his inspector, Eddie Indelicato asking him where he is. Eddie replies that he caught a man that pulled out a gun and thinks he may be involved. Another lady was also with him, but she managed to run away.</p><p>Maxine is in a tree, trying to take this all in. She realises she has been shot at, drugged and is now on the run from the police, all because of her friend Valerie, who is also the Silver Swan. She denies that her loving friend is the Silver Swan. No matter how much Henry Armbruster may have transformed her physically, she must be the same person with the same heart and mind.</p><p>Up above, Silver Swan is still flying around and thinks to herself that her aim wasn’t to hit the Ferris wheel, she was aiming for Wonder Woman. She realises that this is all her fault and pleads to Henry for help.</p><p>Wonder Woman manages to lower the Ferris wheel and Henry and Mister Choi continue to monitor Valerie’s life signs. Choi comments that her life signs are getting dangerously high and they realise that they are losing control of her. Henry grabs a mic and talks to her through that, telling her to not panic or else it’ll ruin everything they’ve planned for. She tells her to remember everything that he has taught her, and to prepare herself for level three force blast. She responds that she might hurt people, but he tells her not to argue and to just go ahead with it. Silver Swan is hesitant at first, but then she screams and when it’s over, people are deaf and have headaches, and million of dollars of property have been destroyed. Lt. Shands calls Eddie and asks him if he is alright. Eddie replies that he is, but the suspect he caught escaped. Wonder Woman asks Vanessa if she is alright, and she says she is fine, apart from being temporarily deaf.</p><p>Silver Swan above catches the attention of the people and says that that is only the icing on the cake and has a lot more to offer. She orders the people to stay where she is while her people arrive to steal money off them. This entire event has been organised only to promote Wonder Woman and to promote some feminine ideal that the Amazon Princess cannot fulfill. Diana is deeply cut by these words as a van with mask men come out. They order Miss Conney and Skeeter to give them the money they have. Wonder Woman asks Cooney to forgive her, but Cooney accuses her of just promoting herself, and is planning to sue the Mayer agency.</p><p>From the control room, Choi apologises for doubting Henry and he says that he has complete control over her. Now all she has to do is collect the computer chips with the Fair’s receipts and they will have complete control over Silicon Valley.</p><p>At the fair, the gang tells Wonder Woman to take their shares to Silver Swan. Wonder Woman takes the two bags up and as she does, she wonders if her fame really has affected her judgement. Maxine watches as Wonder Woman flies towards her friend and she tries to think up how Valerie has ended like this. Wonder Woman goes to give the bags to Silver Swan, and Maxine sees Solomon below, aiming his gun at her. He knows that she will have to lower her force field for Wonder Woman to give the bags. Maxine shouts out just as Solomon pulls the trigger. Wonder Woman reacts to the shout and deflects the bullet with her with her bracelets. Valerie shouts the word “traitor” down at Solomon and the wave destroys the tree and his body falls to the ground. Wonder Woman then grabs Silver Swan with her shield down and she pushes her away from the city. Silver Swan then executes a graceful move and distances herself away from Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman slaps Silver Swan and stuns her as she falls to the ground. Wonder Woman unhooks her lasso to grab Silver Swan but Henry tells her to snap back into focus before Wonder Woman can catch her. Silver Swan then reactivates her force field and the field sends an energy backlash through Wonder Woman’s lasso and electrocutes Wonder Woman’s body.</p><p>Wonder Woman starts falling to the ground and Silver Swan tells Henry that she has defeated the Amazon Princess. Henry tells her that she isn’t easy to defeat and Silver Swan has to finish her. Silver Swan then sings a song, sending a sonic wave through the waters, just missing Wonder Woman. She realises that she must resurface quickly as she didn’t have a chance to take a breath and so she must find a way to muffle Silver Swan’s scream. An idea comes to her head, inspired by Vanessa at the beach one day. Wonder Woman removes her cape and waits for the opportunity between Silver Swan’s sonic waves. She then launches herself out of the water and the wet cape that Wonder Woman twisted snaps and sends Silver Swan flying through the air. She then uses her tiara to clip Silver Swan’s wings and she falls to the ocean below. Wonder Woman then flies down to catch the falling Silver Swan and wraps her around in the wet cape, muffling her screams. Wonder Woman tells her to surrender and Silver Swan is thrashing around. In the control room, he life signs are off the scale as there is an eerie silence and a catastrophic explosion follows.</p><p>In the control room, the readings have died and Choi apologises for Henry’s loss. Henry is angry and rages that “if only the little idiot hadn't panicked!” Just then, they pick up a weak signal and Henry orders a helicopter to collect the Silver Swan and says that it’s time that she learned why he is not a man to disobey.</p><p>Along the shores, Silver Swan flies and is filled with images of a disappointed Henry. She whispers for him to forgive her and that she will do better next time.</p><p>In Pilgrim’s Village, the people living there look on in surprise at the battered Wonder Woman. She gets up and they ask her if she is okay. She says that she if okay and she makes her way back to Boston. She has no idea what happened to the Silver Swan but she hopes she is okay. She is guilty enough as her own fame has caused a good cause to become destroyed. Julia warned her that she must be careful of the choices she makes, and she wonders if she can learn anything from this day. A little later during sunset, she and Steve meet to share a secret. Wonder Woman tells Steve of her origin and he tells the Princess that he could feel a special connection between them two. Wonder Woman having met Steve’s mother, she tells her how his mother has become proud of him and without her, many Amazons would be dead now and that her courage will be honoured forever. She took Diana Trevor’s weapon, and she places it in his hands and tells him that his mother wanted him to have it.</p><p>The next day, a TV reports about the attack from Silver Swan and the robbery was stopped by Lt. Michael Shands and Inspector Ed Indelicato. Ed explains how they stopped the van while Wonder Woman was fighting with Silver Swan, but they cannot find the two bags that the Silver Swan dropped, and with her presumed dead, they might not find what was in those bags. Meanwhile on an airliner, Maxine reads a letter from Valerie and whispers “Oh Val... what did that bastard do to you?” Soloman is also in a critical condition and say that his female accomplice has shouted something before he fired, and they have idea what connection she has with him or the Silver Swan.</p><p><em>Prologue</em></p><p>After a week, Vanessa is rehearsing what she wants to say to Diana. Even though they are both friends, Barry, Vanessa’s boyfriend, is always staring at her, and it has to stop. Diana needs to find her own man and stop tempting Barry. Diana then knocks and enters asking why Vanessa is not ready for school yet and Vanessa replies that her stomach hurts. Diana goes to call the doctor, but then Vanessa says it’s not a stomach ache and that they both have to talk. She notices what Wonder Woman is so fascinated with, and she realises that it is Superman. Unlike her Amazon sisters, she has never seen a man until Steve Trevor and she doesn’t understand the bond between the sexes. Vanessa has Barry, Steve has Etta, and Hippolyta has Hercules. But she has no one, and in her dreams, Superman is like a god. Vanessa then exclaims “You’ve got the hots for Superman!” and Diana corrects her, saying that it is a feeling she cannot explain whenever she sees him. Vanessa adds that she is perfect for Superman, and that she should get Myndi to set up a meeting between them two.</p><p>A few days later at the Myndi Mayer office, Diana waits why Myndi makes the call. Myndi is speaking with Clark Kent, who seems to have close connections with Superman. She tells him that this would be a multi-million event, and that the Daily Planet will have exclusive serialisation rights to the romance if Clark can contact Superman. Outside, Myndi tells Diana that she can meet Clark and they agree to meet on the weekend. Myndi asks Clark where the meeting is going to take place as she needs to set up the cameras. Clark replies that Superman hasn’t told him a meeting yet, leaving Myndi desperate to get back on the phone with Clark.

It flies through the storm that separates Paradise Island from Man’s World and it continues flying to its intended destination.</p><p>Elsewhere in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Steve is loading luggage into a truck while Etta gives Diana a U.N. passport which will allow her to travel to Greece Diana also thanks both Etta and Steve for clearing out the myths that she is American, which she isn’t. Etta replies that people would make that mistake, referring to her costume. Etta also apologises for mistaking Steve’s and Diana relationship before she explained the origin of her costume. When Steve told Diana that he loved Etta, Diana too was a little jealous. Meanwhile, Vanessa is speaking to her friend, Eileen and she tells her friend that Diana and Superman enjoy each other’s company and cannot wait to Barry as well. Eileen replies that Vanessa needs to stop being blind, because Barry, Vanessa’s boyfriend is only using her to get closer to Wonder Woman. Once he finds out that Wonder Woman is falling for Superman, he’ll break up with Vanessa. Vanessa says that Eileen is just jealous and says that she won’t be her friend. Under pressure, Eileen pleads for Vanessa to not stop being her friend. Diana then calls to Vanessa and tells her that she has to go. Vanessa hangs up, and goes downstairs where Diana and Etta are waiting for her. Steve comes in and tells them that a dove had been tapping at the door and he says that he has a funny feeling that it’s for Diana. Her face lights up as it must be from Themyscira and she says it’s a letter from her mother. They are soon in the car on the way to the airport and Vanessa asks Diana to read the letter.</p><p>Hippolyta writes that all is well on Paradise Island, but they experienced a disturbance in Mount Olympus. At first there was a storm, but then it quickly deceased so she asked Menalippe to ask the gods what was happening. They didn’t get a reply which meant nothing was wrong, though Hippolyta felt that the storms were somehow connected with her daughter. Menalippe also felt uneasy, but she was confident that Diana was safe. Etta is who listening asks if everything <em>is</em> going OK. Diana replies that the storms were probably just a manifestation of the confrontation she and Superman had with Darkseid. Diana continues reading the letter, and it says that the debate about Paradise Island having contact with Man’s World has continued. Hellene has been elected to lead the party for isolationism, and even though her mother is for Diana’s views, Hellene’s points are very strong. To decide, the Amazons have gone to the library where they study the pictures of Man’s World that Diana brought back. This morning, Hippolyta had lain on the clay in which Diana was formed, and gazes upon the “light image” (photograph). It was a picture of Diana with the arm around Julia – Hippolyta wishes very much so that she could do the same thing as she has been longing to do so for a very long time. Hippolyta adds that she is proud of her daughter and that she misses her very much. ""May the Glory of Gaea be with you."" A tear runs down on Diana’s cheek and Steve hopes to meet her someday as she sounds like a wonderful woman.</p><p>They arrive at the airport, Etta is making arrangements and Diana is writing a reply to her mother’s letter. She rolls it up and wraps it to the dove’s leg and kisses it on the head, sending the dove back to Themyscira. About an hour later, Steve and Etta are watching Vanessa and Diana board the plane to Greece.</p><p>In Mount Olympus the gods and goddesses survey the destruction around them as Apollo recites a mournful poem. An angry Hercules tells him to stop reciting. He says that Darkseid should be made to pay for all this and is about to storm out when Zeus asks him to calm down, and he cannot face Darkseid alone. Hermes agrees and adds that he is right. Even though Diana and Superman had helped, the reason why the island only survived was because of its magical nature. Hercules says that they must unite together to defeat Darkseid and Hera agrees, but they will not wage war. The history is filled with bloodshed and it is a time for a new era of gods. Hermes questions about Ares though, as he was never one of tranquillity. Hercules however is unconvinced and begs the gods to strike back. Even if Hercules is allowed to strike, if Darkseid comes back, there will no gods and Olympus has served them well, but rebuilding it would take too long and they do not have time on their side. The decision is final and Zeus raises his sceptre to join with Hades and Poseidon to seal the pact. With a flash of lightning, Zeus disappears and Hercules curses his father. Artemis comments to Athena that Hercules’ temper may test Zeus’ new patience. Aphrodite asks Hephaestus if he has noticed that Hermes is acting strange of late. Hephaestus replies that he has lost his son, and can’t Aphrodite see that? But she replies that Hermes always had something in him, a special trait that he had is now lost. Hephaestus replies that maybe he is tired of being a god.</p><p>Hermes looks down upon an airplane in which Vanessa and Diana have boarded. She thinks how this journey has tired Vanessa so much and how she could answer Vanessa’s questions regarding Superman. But she cannot explain it to someone so young when she can barely understand it herself. Diana managed Superman to be like a god and maybe her expectations had been too high seeing as she was confused. She thought they would have more in common than just superpowers. While she wishes to teach peace, he seems to be the enforcer and the guardian of this universe. She is disappointed with what she sees and knows, and doesn’t want to express it publicly, and he prays that he understands that. The pilot then announces that they will be landing soon, and Diana wakes Vanessa. She asks Diana if she is excited and Diana replies that she is, but also a little nervous, though she will be happy to see Diana. At the airport, Julia and Stavros Christadoulodou are waiting and he asks Julia is she is excited to see them. She replies that she is excited to see them as she hasn’t in such a long time, and Stavros is excited in meeting Diana. The crowd spot Diana and they starting cheering, and Julia embraces Diana. Not far away however, a nervous individual watches. Julia introduces Stavros to Diana and Diana replies in Greek. Stavros comments that she knows how to speak Greek quite well, and kisses her hand. Vanessa yawns again and Julia asks Stravros if they can get to the hotel first. They are also set to meet the Prime Minister and there, there will be a banquet with speeches and press. They climb into the vehicle when the individual watches them with a parchment in his hands. He needs to talk to her and warn her! He walks through some undergrowth until he hears a noise and sees a cat with glowing red eyes. The crowd starts cheering again and the stranger looks up in a tree, with a hawk watching him, with red eyes as well. He runs to escape the animals, but his screams are drowned out by the roaring crowd.</p><p>A few days later in America Myndi Mayer reads the story on the front page in which Diana is meeting the Greek Prime Minister. She pours herself another alcoholic drink and calls for her aide, Myndi and asks her to send a memo to all the department heads for a meeting. She also asks to get some more alcohol and Chrissie comments on her drinking, saying that she has probably had a bit too much. Myndi snaps back telling her not to lecture her as it has been a bad day and that everyone has been wanting to talk with her except Diana, but she is just a perfect Boston cheerleader. Chrissie tells Myndi that she has not been herself and that she knows who is responsible: Skeeter La Rue. Why doesn’t she fire him? Myndi tells her to quickly send out the memo, and on her way out, Skeeter sarcastically asks if Myndi is giving her a hard time.</p><p>On a small island off the coast of Greece, another woman is looking down on the front page of Wonder Woman and comments to her assistant, Mikos about her captivating style. Mikos replies that she is nothing compared to her and the woman replies that Diana <em>is</em> something. The woman replies that the Amazon’s determination is strong, as she has experienced and she does not like what she senses with his Amazon. Mikos says that she is only here for two weeks, and surely she cannot interfere with their plans, but the woman replies that their last stop is the island Cephalonia and that they should not take her granted.</p><p>The next morning in Acropolis, Diana stands amongst the ruins and traces still remain. The gods <em>were</em> here. She can see the light reflect off drawn swords as her mother’s marched over this land. Themyscira was once situated here and now she can see why the gods place so much faith in here, because Man did not want the gods here anymore. They may not be worshipped, but they are still remembered as cities are named after them. She crosses her hands and her bracelets touch and prays to Athena to grant her wisdom to find the voice that will inspire her. Somewhere else, Vanessa, Julia and Stavros wait around the ruins and Vanessa peers through the binoculars, saying how Diana is praying once again. Julia tells her how much trouble it took to allow the PM to allow Diana to walk through the Acropolis and the least she can do is respect her privacy. Vanessa tells Stavros how she always prays in nude when Julia silences her. Stavros says he misses the both of them teasing each other. Diana continues her tours through Greece when she realises how Man once worshipped the gods as greatly as she sees the magnificent buildings. Diana sheds a tear as she wishes her sisters to sleep well. But as long as the Amazons live, there will be peace.</p><p>On board a boat on the Ionian Sea as Diana and Julia look across the water. Diana tells Julia that she never knew it was so beautiful here and cannot understand why she visits Greece every year. Julia replies that she was born here and that she was married here. Diana says that she never knew that she had a husband and Julia replies that he was the finest man she ever knew and goes on to describing him when Diana is then distracted by an island and asks Julia if that is Cephalonia. Julia doesn’t even know what that island is called and she has heard that some billionaire lives on it. Diana feels eerie around it and she tightens her jacket as she feels a cold chill go down her spine. As the boat steers back to mainland, the woman watches and murmurs ""Let that be your first warning Amazon!""</p><p>Meanwhile, on the island of Cephalonia, there are sheep grazing until a sheep herder shouts and the others race over to see what is happening. They see a dead man, as if he were torn to shreds by animals. His face has been torn away, but one sheep herder recognises the jacket and says it is Paul Drivas, rumoured that he had a ""Magia"" on him. Another sheep herder replies that that is just superstition but another replies that there are no wolf tracks, only sheep tracks. Not far away, a lone sheep as glowing red eyes as well, watching the debate.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""<em>Publishorial</em>"" 2/3 page text piece by Jenette Kahn.</li><li>""<em>DC

After the three had killed their father, they hid the scroll called “The Olympian Pact”. Zeus comments on the pact, saying that the rule should be divided equally amongst the three of them, and it took a mortal woman to make him realise that. Hades corrects his brother, saying that Wonder Woman is no mere mortal as she has earned the respect amongst Man. The three brothers continue with the pact. Poseidon raises his trident, Hades his staff and Zeus with his sceptre and the symbols that represent their power come together and a new scroll is created, getting rid of the old one.</p><p>On the islands of Greece in a hospital, Julia, Vanessa, Stavros, a young boy and another man sit around Diana where she lays. A doctor comes in and tells Julia that she is healthy woman and that there is nothing wrong with her, but Julia is unconvinced as she felt how cold Diana was when she went to grab her as she fainted when passing by one of the islands. The doctor recommends prescribing drugs, but Diana refuses. He complies but he adds that she should rest. Vanessa then gives Diana her tiara and lasso, and tells Diana not to scare her like that again. The young boy asks Stavros whether he still believes in “Magia” and if it has been placed on Diana. The other man tells the young boy not to be so disrespectful in front of Diana. Julia introduces them as Mr. Theophillus Ventouras and his nephew, Demetrios. Julia continues on, saying that Ventouras is one of the wealthiest men. He tells Diana that he has been called down here for business, as a boy had been killed and some people are saying that “Magia” killed him. Vanessa asks what “Magia” is and he replies that is a curse and his nephew adds that it comes from that island that Diana fainted to. She is created from all things mystical yet she still exists in real life. Ventouras then invites them over for dinner as maybe they can solve the mystery of the island with his large collection of books. Diana accepts his invitation and a nurse outside her room is listening in. She exits the hospital and tells Mikos all she has heard. He thanks the nurse and tells her that his mistress will award her for her loyalty.</p><p>Not far away, a boy and a girl are sitting on a bench and have been listening in on the conversation that Katina, the girl, whispers to the boy, that Spiros, the nurse is working for the witch. Spiros pleads them to leave and extra careful, as the witch’s beast knows everything. Look at what happened to Paul in the meadow. Katina tells the boy that they must be very aware of their surroundings if they are to warn Diana. They look up to Mikos who is now a black hawk and flies back to the island. Once he is out of sight, they leave to make plans.</p><p>In the evening, Diana is at the dinner and is introduced to Agostos and Maria Deneiros and is honoured to meet Julia’s parents, but Maria reminds her that this is a Christian home. Julia apologises for her mother, but Diana understands. She tells Maria that their faiths have things in common: peace, understanding and love. Maria asks Diana if she is hungry and asks her to join her in the kitchen to help. Agostos wishes he was forty years younger and asks Diana if she enjoys fishing. He then puts on his coat and says to Stavros if they should go out in an hour to watch the boats. Agostos insists going to the tavern first, but Stavros promised Maria that he would not him wander. As they walk towards the car, Stavros notices that there is a note put under the wiper blade. He reads it, and he suddenly tells that Agostos that he has remembered an important engagement. Agostos asks if he can come along, but Stavros says no and sends him home and then drives off.</p><p>Mikos then is nearing the island where his mistress lives. He lands and takes the form as a human and makes his way inside. He tells her that Diana is foolish to learn the secrets of this island and she says that she is not surprised.</p><p>Back at Julia’s parent’s house, Diana is looking through an old family photo album while Julia is brushing her hair. She looks at one photo where Julia is young and she is sitting next to her brother and she says that since she came to Greece, she found that she has a lot more to learn about her friend. Julia tells of her brother, where she died in World War II fighting in the Greek Resistance. Her father and brother used to sail together, and after he died, Julia wanted to sail with her father, but it was never the same. Having a son in the family is very important as it continues the family name and now all Julia’s father does is sit and watch the boats all day. Diana replies that that is unfair as a female also bears the family name though Julia explains that when she and David were engaged, she decided to keep her maiden name, but the family went crazy over that, so she became Dr. Julia “Kapatelis” in order to keep peace, but she kept it after David died as a tribute. Julia then sees Diana’s eyes swelling with tears and she tells Diana that she has a great career, a great daughter and Diana and she feels she is all very lucky. Diana smiles and replies likewise.</p><p>In the village of Lodiros, Stavros knocks on the door of Gregori’s house. The door opens by itself and he feels a gun pointed to his head. By a candle, Gregori tells Katina not to be so melodramatic and Stavros asks him if the note is a death threat to Diana to his doing. Gregori replies that it is not a threat, but a warning: if Diana stays here, she will surely die. They have tried to warn Diana, but they have failed so far. Stavros accuses Gregori of twisting this story, but Gregori replies that it is true. At first, he didn’t believe it, but then when his friends were mauled and his leg got torn off, he then believed. Stavros asks what proof he has to show that this has something to do with Diana, and Gregori hands over a scroll that Stavros could decipher with his skills. It has been taken from the island and has been preserved as Stavros comments on it. Suddenly, they hear a gun fire outside and they find Spiros and another girl, Andrea, look into the undergrowth. Spiros tells them that they shot a cat with red eyes. Katina asks where the corpse is, but Spiros replies that they cannot find it. She then orders Spiros to go with Stavros and keep an eye on him. Maybe Stavros is truly a friend, but she cannot take any chances.</p><p>Later that day at Professor Christadoulodou's home, Stavros studies the scroll as Spiros watches over. He has discovered something: the alphabet that dates back to Minoan times and is similar to the Amazons’ language. Just then, the door bell rings and it’s Vanessa calling for Stavros.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the home of Theophilus Ventouras, Julia thanks him for the banquet. He replies that it is a shame that her daughter could not join her, but Julia explains that she was allowed to call Barry if she finished her holiday homework. They both enter the library and see Diana dressed in a toga, sitting at a desk with piles of books. They ask if Diana has discovered anything, and she replies that the island is owned by someone called Cassandra Colchis, and she is a wealthy recluse. Julia detects something in Diana’s voice and she replies that she keeps remembering the feeling that came over her when she passed the island and she asks if there is anyway to meet Miss Colchis, but she is apparently a firm believer in “private” property. Julia reassures Diana that the woman on the island is just a crazy lady and they both head back to Stavros’ to pick up Vanessa. As they depart, Ventouras turns to Mikos and tells him that the Amazon Princess is no longer a threat because she believes that all this talk about the witch is just superstition. When Diana leaves, the rebel will be weak on morale. Then, another man enters with Demitrios, dead in his arms. Ventouras hugs the lifeless boy in distraught as Mikos explains that he had been killed by one of the rebels called Spiros. Ventouras, with his eyes raging red yells that they will pay and summons the others to seek vengeance. He starts chanting a spell and all of a sudden, the people around town turn into wild beasts as a storm brews above the mysterious island. As they drive towards Stavros’ home, they hear a string of wild beasts and as they turn around the bend, they see his house on fire. Diana gets out of the car and flies into the blazing house and she calls out to them. She hears a weak voice call out to her.</p><p>Outside, Julia is anxious when Diana bursts out carrying a body. She lays Stavros to the ground, but Vanessa is no where to be seen but Stavros tells her that Vanessa managed to escape. There were also remains of a mauled boy who had been trampled by a horse but Julia replies that there are no horses around here. Diana tells Julia to take Stavros to the hospital and she removes the remains of her toga and underneath it is her costume. Julia realises that Diana had been expecting trouble and she watches Diana take to the air hearing her say that the witch is no myth! Wonder Woman prays that Vanessa is OK as she scans the ground below her. She spots a young girl waving her arm and she seems to be holding a scroll. She descends but Vanessa warns her when a huge hawk flies out and knocks Diana out of the sky and Vanessa rushes to see if she is alright. They then hear a voice, demanding that the scroll be handed over and they find themselves surrounded by beasts. The Centaur demands that the scroll be handed to them and Wonder Woman recognises that voice: it’s Ventouras! Wonder Woman quickly lays her lasso around Vanessa and herself and tells her to stay in the circle as it will protect her from these creatures. She then readies herself for battle and a string of shrieks are screamed out as she ploughs through the creatures. She tries to hold them back and they swarm around her, beating and clawing into her, when she has no choice and she goes full force. Then, a huge thunder strike hits her in the back and she falls to the ground motionless. She instructs to leave the girl, but they should bring Diana to <em>her</em>. Now, Diana will finally meet the witch, also known as Circe.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""<em>Creatures of the Dark</em>"" written and penciled by George Perez, inked by Dick Giordano,

They found her lying inside Diana’s lasso where she protected from the mystical beasts. Vanessa explains how Stavros told her to escape with the scroll and how Diana was struck by a thunder bolt. Julia assumes that she is still under shock, but Vanessa speaks the truth. Katina is there, who is apart of the resistance against the witch. She tells Julia that the scroll and the beasts belong to the witch. Julia asks why Cassandra Colchis would do such a thing and she turns to her mother. She says that her name is <em>not</em> Cassandra.</p><p>On the island, Diana wakes up and realises that she is tied down by chains. She sees a woman lying on her bed, sipping a drink. The woman welcomes Diana to the island of Aeaea and introduces herself as Circe. That name rings a bell with Diana, and Circe laughs, saying that she is the daughter of Hyperion and Perseis, who is ultimately Diana’s executioner. Diana struggles but Circe tells her that it is useless as she had forged them herself. No mortal can break them. Circe tells her that as long as Diana is alive, she will always get in the way of her plans. She then orders her beasts to take Diana to Atelier for her death tonight. Dian resists and kicks the beast with her free leg. She tells her that an Amazon does not die so easily and that she doesn’t know why she hates her so much. Circe raises her hand and strikes a bolt at Diana, this time worse than before. Circe’s beasts wonder if she has killed her, but she reassures them that it will take more than that. She fights like a true Amazon as even though she is bound, she still fights back and she orders her beasts to quickly take her to the intended destination. She turns to Mikos, who is in his bird form and tells him that he will have to guard Aeaea. As long as the rebels have the scroll, they have a chance of rescuing Diana.</p><p>In the rebel’s hideout, Julia is studying the scroll and Gregori asks her what she has found. He is anxious to find out as he thinks the scroll is the key to defeating Circe, but has not been able to decipher it. Julia replies that Stavros is a brave man and rolled all in notes in the scroll, so Julia could decipher it, or this would have taken days. Katina returns and says that Vanessa has been returned to her parents’ home and that Professor Christadoulodou is in hospital but could not get any news on him. The police aren’t taking any action because so far, it looks like animal attacks. Katina asks Gregori how the deciphering is going, and Julia looks sternly at them. She says that Diana is more than a savior, she is like a daughter and nothing will stop her from rescuing Diana. Gregori replies that the boy who had the scroll was his son, and Katina’s finance. This battle is quite personal to them too. A few moments later, Julia exclaims “Bingo!” and has found a way to save Diana. It is not the scroll itself, but a twine used to bind the scroll with a mystic herb called “Moly”.</p><p>Back on Circe’s island, Diana is surrounded by black and she fights her way back to consciousness. She opens her eyes to find herself high above Circe’s laboratory where the witch is boiling something in a cauldron and she remarks how determined the Amazon is but is a shame that her determination compels her to kill Diana. Diana demands to know where she is and that contained in the shelves are her successes, the legacy of Hectate, the Moon Goddess. She tells Diana to stay comfortable as this will take a while, and begins telling her story to kill the last hours of Diana’s life.</p><p>Hectate was born a Titan, but he was not apart of the Olympians, though he was highly respected by Zeus. She was one of the Trinity of the Moon along with Artemis, the Maiden, the Mother and Demeter. After Zeus overthrew the Titans, he banished them, and their dead leader, Chronus into a dark endless void. New races of gods were created from the God of War’s energy and she might even conquer the Olympians who need time to rebuild so Hectate cast a spell that would mask all Titan-Olympians conflict and so when the Olympians emerged, they would seem like a new breed of gods. Diana then thinks to herself, and now knows why Darkseid called the Olympians <em>his</em> offspring! Hectate was never comfortable with the Olympians so she married Hades and stayed underground. Hades had a roving eye and then married Persephone. Hectate was then made a handmaiden. Hera hated Zeus’ respect for Hectate and forbade any Olympian to help out Hectate. As time went by, her revenge grew stronger and Hectate returned to Earth and this where Circe’s story begins. She had been the Princess of Colchis herself at one point but her subjects wanted to kill her husband, so she came to this island and this is where swore that anyone who got in her way would meet their death. Her magic casting proved ineffective on Aeaea so she used the Sirens to sing their luring lullabies to lure seamen to her island. Those who survived on the rocks met Circe and faced their death. But she still wanted more power and she sold her soul for it. Hectate answered her prayers and she was then an instrument to use against Gods who wronged her. Hectate proposed that to gain beauty, immortality and power, all she had to do was trade souls with her. As they prepared to trade souls, Hectate’s last words were ""Upon the death pf Witch and the birth of Witch, Hectate, by name and choice, shall repossess her soul."" With a burst of mystic flame, Circe’s soul turned into ash and from the ashes, a new Circe was born. Hectate’s body was destroyed, and it seemed unlikely that she would even reclaim her soul and so it belonged to Circe. She also developed an art which allowed her to transform men into beasts. Her reputation grew that men feared her and everyone woman that they would meet.</p><p>Circe’s first successful strike was the alienation of the sexes. She pitted them against each other and Hectate felt betrayed by both sexes, so both sexes has to suffer. It was then that the Amazons were born and Circe feared that their mission to preach peace and equality would succeed but Ares reassured her that nothing like that would ever happen. When Hercules destroyed Themyscira, Circe assumed it was safe and Diana’s aunty, Antiope returned to avenge the Amazons for what Hercules did. There was much bloodshed, but then Theseus, Antiope’s formed captor fell in love with each other and he begged forgiveness. They both married and Circe had no spell to break them up. Then there was Ariadne, Theseus’ ex-wife and was carrying a dagger. When Antiope was sleeping, she stabbed it into Antiope’s heart. Diana’s eyes are clouded with tears and she cries “No more!” and breaks the chains she was in. Circe then protects herself with a bolt of energy and Diana falls to the ground. Circe was not meant to release such a deadly bolt, but she was surprised by her ability to break free of <em>her</em> chains. Ventouras checks Diana to see if she is still alive and Circe asks him if she is still alive – he replies that she is still breathing. A few minutes later, Circe finishes her preparation for the potion and announces it is time for the Rites of Finality. An image of Mikos appears in Circe’s globe and the rebels have reached the island. Circe demands how this is possible, but Mikos is clueless too, and for some reason, he and the beasts couldn’t get close to them. She orders them to kill the rebels.</p><p>On the shores, Julia, Katina and the rest disembark from the boat which has Diana’s lasso wrapped around the hull. One of rebels yell that the beasts are coming and Katina tells them not to panic and anticipate them, so that they can throw the fire bombs. Then, the beasts are incinerated. The rebels open fire with their weapons as more beasts come to attack. Julia notices that the lasso pulses faster every time they get closer to the tower. Katine then orders a group of rebels to follow them so that they can fight their way into the tower. They make their way up the stairs and are confronted by Mikos who is preparing to kill them where they stand.</p><p>Behind Mikos is where Diana is and she is coming to again. She finds herself stuck in mud with just her head protruding.</p><p>Outside the chamber the rebels fire at Mikos as inside, Circe continues how her influence has spread throughout the world. Once Diana had arrived in Greece, people began learning of Circe’s truth and they began to hate her, even her own beasts. That is when Hectate’s words began to make sense. The Moon Goddess has gone under many names, one of them being Diana. Hectate said ""Upon the death of Witch and birth of Witch, Hectate, by name and choice, shall repossess her soul,"" and Circe tells Diana that she is the second witch! If Diana kills Circe, her soul will be repossessed by Diana and that power, combined with Hectate will be unstoppable. Diana replies that she does not want to kill Circe but she replies that she has no choice. Circe holds up a cup that has a potion in it and explains that once she throws this on the mud Diana is surrounded in, she will begin to become part of the mud, devolving into the clay form she once was. Circe then prepares to tip the cup and it is shattered by a bullet. Julia rushes in and throws Diana the lasso to Diana’s outstretched hand. Circe then prepares to release a bolt and Julia quickly and tears off a piece of the twin she has brought. The bolt hits her, but she is unscathed. Circe uses this as a distraction and releases a bolt towards Diana and falls to the floor. Diana finds that she can’t move from the blast, and Ventouras comes in and disarms her.</p><p>Circe looks down at Diana and tells her that her death is inevitable. She walks towards Julia and raises her hand, preparing for the attack Diana tries to get up on her feet and tells her that this fight is between her and Circe. But Circe prepares to kill Julia and with a blinding flash of light everything goes dark. Julia calls out for Diana and they are lying on the ground outside, where the tower seems to have disappeared. Diana cannot understand what happened. Just then, Katina and the other rebels are happy to see them and she tells them that all the creatures are gone and that Diana had slain Circe. Diana tries to tell them what happened, but she is drowned out by “All hail Diana!”</p><p>In Mount Olympus, Hermes is watching from above and thinks to himself that Zeus won’t be happy with him for interfering. But he could not let her think that all gods abandoned her, he had to save her. She should have been warned about Circe, and the gods owe her that much.</p><p>A week later at the Athens airport, Diana and Julia make a phone call to Stavros who is recovering in hospital. He tells them he is fine and that Katina would love to speak to Diana again. Katina still believes that Diana killed Circe but she remembered the witch’s eyes before she had vanished and her intuition tells her that it is not over between the two of them. How can she tell Katina that? Julia tells that Diana is tired and wishes them well. Vanessa then comes running with a newspaper in her hand and holds up the front page with a picture of Myndi Mayer with the headline ""Star Publicist Found Slain!""</p>",,,,,,,False,29918,"{'icon_url':

But she floats down from above. One of the thugs fires a bullet and she blocks it with her bracelets and she grabs the gun, crushing it. She then sends him crashing near some rubbish bins. Another thug tries to cut her with his knife but Wonder Woman disarms him and drops to the floor.</p><p>At a crime scene, Inspector Ed. Indelicato arrives at a crime scene and discovers that Myndi Mayer has been dead for a few hours and he looks up at the walls of her office. He then notices one of the pictures, and that is Wonder Woman. Lt. Shands then comes in and asks the detectives what they have discovered. One replies that she didn’t give up without a fight, and she also had an empty purse. Ed then replies saying that all this blood seems pretty extreme for a simple robbery and the other detectives agree, saying that they found cocaine on her table. The cleaning lady who discovered Myndi’s dead body said that there was a short man with a white beard entering, who looked quite upset, entered the building and had a jacket with the words “Common Sense” on the back of it. The coroners take the body away and the two detectives ask Christine, Myndi’s secretary, asks her about her boss’s murder. Christine says she isn’t even surprised and when Lt. Shands shows her a sketch of the murderer, and Christine gasps in surprise and says that it is Steve London, an ex-artist of Myndi’s. She had fired him a week ago. Finding Steve London was easy, as there were blood stains on his jacket and he stunk of beer. He speaks to the detectives and tells them he wanted to talk to his ex-boss, but not kill her. He doesn’t even own a gun. He explains how her art staff was called into a meeting, and he says how he could smell alcohol in her coffee and her nose was all puffy. She proceeded to rant how they had many lawsuits filed against them and that everyone was fired on the spot and Deni had taken it really badly. The detectives ask who this Deni is and says that she was Myndi’s ex-assistant and didn’t Skeeter La Rue who was also in the conference meeting, or Myndi and Deni and Steve had decided to drunk in a bar. Just then, Steve remembered saying something about Skeeter and Myndi and it was something that made Steve furious. He starts to sob and puts his hands in his heads and starts whispering ""Oh God! I couldn't have! I couldn't have killed her! Could I?""</p><p>Meanwhile, Wonder Woman makes her way to Choi Industries Headquarters and Mr. Choi greets her. She tells him she needs to speak with Skeeter La Rue as he seems to be working for Mr. Choi. He replies that no one like that has been employed here and she replies that <em>that</em> is impossible. Maybe La Rue isn’t on his records, but he certainly has worked here before and tells him that she needs to find him. Mr. Choi tells her that he cannot help her, but Diana begs if he can. Choi’s bodyguard then holds Wonder Woman by the arm and takes her outside, but she resists and he is then seen flying across the room. Choi then dials for the police and but before he can finish dialing, he is tied up in the Lasso of Truth and he then tells Wonder Woman where Skeeter is. He writes down the address of a nearby warehouse and Wonder Woman then puts her thumb on his forehead and puts him to sleep.</p><p>Meanwhile, while Ed Indelicato is questioning Steve London, he says that he is innocent when later they find that a shotgun is out the back Myndi’s office building with his fingerprints over it. They then interviewed Deni and she told them that she snooped around Skeeter’s office and found that he was a drug dealer and had been using the client list to score some big money with the drugs he got, and one of these clients was Myndi. That’s the reason why he had reached the top so quickly. She continued saying that when some other clients found out about this, that’s when the trouble started and that it has something to do with the Wonder Woman Fair. Hearing this, Ed thinks back to the fair, and remembers Solomon Buchman. They had tried to find some leads on him but were unsuccessful. Silver Swan was to get the specially marked bag, which apparently contained some special chips so they could sell it for some drug money. Deni had even shown Myndi the papers which proved Skeeter was a drug dealer, but Myndi just glared at her. Deni had begged Myndi to give back Steve’s job, as it was clear has who Skeeter <em>really</em> was, but Myndi refused and said to her that if she would let any of this get out, <em>she</em> would lose her job. When Deni told this to Steve who was drunk, he stormed out. Now it seems very clear that Steve is the murderer, but the two detectives think that some things don’t add up, so look through his records and find many crimes that he’s committed and his real name is Michael Boyd. They warrant a search for Skeeter La Rue. Just then, a visitor wishes to speak with Ed Indelicato and it turns out to be Wonder Woman herself, along with Julia Kapatelis and Christine Fenton. Ed feels like he is in a dream when he sees her, but he snaps back to reality, and a flashback comes about.</p><p>At Drake Warehouse, Skeeter is inside and is playing cards with his two bodyguards. He then hears a noise and asks his bodyguards to see what it is. They grab their guns and head outside and suddenly, gun fire begins. He cowers in the corner and the office window shatters and standing there is Wonder Woman. She unhooks her lasso and tells him that if he cooperates, he will not be harmed and she asks him who killed Myndi Mayer.</p><p>Wonder Woman asks Ed if they have found out who killed Myndi, he continues to tell the facts of the case. Wonder Woman’s eyes then fill with tears at Myndi’s death but Christine rages that Myndi may have been many things but she was certainly not a smuggler. Wonder Woman feels that Ed also thinks that Steve is innocent, but the DA and his Captain do not. Christine then suggests that Wonder Woman find out who killed Steve and Ed questions how. Wonder Woman then holds up her lasso. Ed asks his Captain but he is not too happy about the idea, but Wonder Woman begs him to let her, but the Captain replies that the Defence Attorney will not be too happy with his client being lassoed. The DA will say that the lasso was used to add credibility to his story, but Wonder Woman reasons with him again, saying that he should be given a chance of whether he should be lassoed or not. The Captain finally allows it, and Steve is enthusiastic, but his lawyer and wife talk him out of it. Wonder Woman looks towards Ed, but he can’t help either and Ed remembers he has that the Boyd case to get to but then Lt. Shands comes back in the office with no Michael Boyd in sight and apparently he is on the run.</p><p>The next morning, Ed gets a call from Shands and he tells Ed that they have found Boyd dead over an electric fence. Wonder Woman was also there and is now waiting inside the warehouse. Lt Shands and Ed are in the warehouse and ask Wonder Woman how she found him. She replies that Deni Hayes had remembered some names on Skeeter’s files and questioned them and their questioning had found Skeeter in this warehouse. Wonder Woman got to use her lasso on him and Skeeter admitted to killing Myndi. Myndi was furious that Skeeter was using her agency as a front for his drug business and she wanted to know how he could do this after all she had done for him and he then placed a packet of cocaine on her desk. She refused and asked him to leave, or he would go down with her. He knew she was bluffing but Mr. Choi, his supplier didn’t trust her so he instructed Skeeter to murder her. He had sneaked in one night and had shot her in the head with his shotgun. Skeeter panicked and turned the office upside down to make it look like a robbery and at the same time, Steve showed up. The two men struggled and Steve fell to the floor, and then Skeeter wiped his fingerprints off the envelope opener which he used to stab Steve, and put it in Myndi’s hands. He then cleaned his fingerprints off the shotgun and made it look like Steve was the murderer. He threw it in the dumpster and then stayed in the warehouse until he was able to get out of the country. When Wonder Woman showed up, she was so upset that she let her guard down and the guards came bursting in and they started shooting at her. She was able to deflect them but Skeeter ran for it and that’s how he got electrocuted. She tells Shands and Indelicato that Steve was <em>not</em> the murderer and was sure that Myndi would have beaten her addiction.</p><p>Ed is uncomfortable as there is a bit more too this than Skeeter murdering Myndi. He tells her that it will be in the newspaper tomorrow morning. Shands then tells Wonder Woman that on the autopsy report, Myndi had died off a hemorrhage, but before she was shot and it was because of large amounts of cocaine and alcohol. It seems that she had taken the drugs Skeeter left on her desk. Wonder Woman is shocked at the truth and says ""Oh Dear Gaea, why? She was so young, so vital!""</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""Based off an idea by Carol Flynn.""</li><li>Last .75 cent issue.</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,30029,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/27063-3824-30029-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",20,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/massachusetts/4020-55745/'}]",Who Killed Myndi Mayer?,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41435/', 'id': 41435, 'name': 'Lasso of Truth', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-57473/', 'id': 57473, 'name': 'Sai', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sai/4055-57473/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51517/', 'id': 51517, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Bracelets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-bracelets/4055-51517/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56852/', 'id': 56852, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Earrings"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-earrings/4055-56852/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51489/', 'id': 51489, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Tiara"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-50470/', 'id': 50470, 'name': 'Art Young', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/art-young/4040-50470/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-4322/', 'id': 4322, 'name': 'Bob McLeod', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bob-mcleod/4040-4322/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2913/', 'id': 2913, 'name': 'George Pérez', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/george-perez/4040-2913/', 'role': 'writer, artist, penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43437/', 'id': 43437, 'name': 'Karen Berger', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/karen-berger/4040-43437/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-67476/', 'id': 67476, 'name': 'Typeset', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/typeset/4040-67476/', 'role': 'letterer'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman-20-who-killed-myndi-mayer/4000-30029/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-61594/', 'id': 61594, 'name': 'Boston Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston-police-department/4060-61594/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-3824/', 'id': 3824, 'name': 'Wonder Woman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman/4050-3824/'}"

takes the chance to talk to her through her dreams and she wakes up startled.</p><p>In the Kapatelis family home, Diana, Julia and Vanessa come back from the funeral regarding Myndi’s death and Vanessa seems very depressed about this, and Diana is quite concerned for her and Julia explains that Vanessa had greatly idolised Myndi. Myndi was talented and she could have wanted anything in the world, and Diana hopes that Julia had raised her well enough so that she does not fall into the world of drugs and alcohol. Julia is also worried for Diana, and she asks her how she has been as she didn’t even speak a word on the car ride home. Diana replies that she cannot help feel but responsible for Myndi’s death. If she had not been so blinded by her own celebrity status, then maybe she could have helped Myndi. She says that at the Fair, Silver Swan attacked <em>her</em>, because of her beauty and begins to doubt if she is fulfilling her mission. She has even asked Superman to call her Diana, not Wonder Woman as she feels that Diana is no longer there. She had gone to Greece to learn about her roots and then Circe attacked her. She wonders why the gods didn’t giver her a sign and why did so many have to die? Was it because she failed the gods that badly or is she not the right person for this mission? Julia comforts Diana and as long as she has the powers which the gods gave her, the gods will always be with her. She says that it was okay to get caught up in the “Wonder Woman” thing as she is only human. Diana wishes that the gods would give her a sign.</p><p>Just then, there is tapping on the door, and Julia opens the door. A dove then files onto Diana’s lap and Vanessa comes out of her room to see what’s happening. Diana tells them that she is needed back home. Vanessa then rushes over to Diana, telling her not to go. Diana says there is nothing to fear, and she will return as soon as possible. Half an hour later, the three stand by the shore of a lake and Diana lifts herself into the air and then Vanessa asks Diana to say “hi” to her mother for her. As Julia and Vanessa watch her become a dot in the sky, Vanessa starts crying and Julia comforts her. Vanessa does not want to lose Diana as well and Julia asks “Like Myndi?” and Vanessa nods her head. They go back in the house, talking about the events that have happened in the past few days.</p><p>Aphrodite and Hermes watch Diana fly through the void that separates them from Man’s World. Hermes comments on Diana’s faith, saying that she still heeds to the call of the gods even though they have placed a lot of evil things upon her and Aphrodite says that her faith is strong. Hermes replies that she does not know the gods like <em>he</em> does and that her blind faith has almost killed her. Aphrodite asks him to join the other gods, but he says that they can wait. Hercules then appears as summoned by Hermes and he asks Hermes what he wants from him. Hermes tells Hercules that he needs to talk and tells Aphrodite that he will join the gods soon. However, Aphrodite tells him that she knows about the fire in his eyes whenever he gazes upon Diana… and that she knows that gaze all too well! She then disappears, leaving the two men to talk.</p><p>In Themyscira, Hippolyta and Penelope wait for Diana’s arrival and the queen notes that Penelope looks nervous. She replies that Menalippe has never looked so excited from sleep. Just then, Diana appears from the horizon and embraces her two sisters. Penelope asks if she has brought the Prayer Robe, and Diana nods, but is confused in why she had to bring it. Hippolyta tells her that all will be revealed once they join the Amazons at the temple.</p><p>Inside the temple, all the Amazons are in there as Diana, Hippolyta and Menalippe are on the altar. She tells them that this day will be remembered as the gods have honoured greatly and by the request of Apollo, Hippolyta and Diana have joined us. The three of them have been asked to appear in front of the gods on Mount Olympus and Menalippe asks her sisters to join them in prayer so that they can prepare for this meeting. The temple is then filled with echoes of chants and then lightning starts to form in the skies and the Amazons are in meditation. Then, a strike of thunder hits the altar and the three disappear. They appear up on Mount Olympus, but are shocked to find that there is rubble everywhere, indicating that some disastrous has happened to the gods’ home. This surely must be a mistake! Hippolyta asks Diana if this is really Mount Olympus, and Diana says it is, yet the rubble shows the severity of Darkseid’s attacks. Menalippe begins to weep and Diana tells her not to lose faith. It was Menalippe who taught her that faith is not just visual; sometimes one must close their eyes to see the light. They all have experienced such wavering. As Julia said before, they are only human. Suddenly the sky is filled with white light and all the gods appear before them. Diana asks them what happened to Olympus and Hera replies that Darkseid has cut deep, and that some scars may never heal. But because of Olympus’ state, they feel they are ready for cosmic migration. They explain to the Amazons, even the ones down below that they have been chosen to assist in bringing about new order. The Amazons are puzzled by this and asks what this means. Hermes steps forward and tells Diana that it should be obvious to her as she too has felt abandonment from the gods. Zeus tells Hermes to keep quiet and that a decision has been made. Hermes tells them to speak the truth, with no cryptic messages, as they have served the gods for so long and in return the Amazons given destruction. Hercules then snaps at Hermes, telling him to stop scaring the Amazons. Hermes replies that perhaps the “brawny” one would like to explain how he plans to betray Hippolyta again. Hercules advances on Hermes, but Athena tells them to stop at once. Athena agrees with Hermes saying how they can continue to a better place when they ignored the people who have brought them here. Menalippe assures them that their faith is strong. Hippolyta agrees, saying that their decision will benefit them in the future. Hermes asks Diana what she thinks and reminds her that these are the gods who left her to deal with Circe alone. Hades says that it is <em>Hermes</em> who has done injustice to Diana, and Poseidon adds that the gods were sure that Diana would defeat Circe on her own. Diana then realises that it was Hermes who transported Circe away during the last minute of their battle.</p><p>Athena explains to Diana that going to Man’s World surely must have taught her that there was a fine line between the differences of Man and the Deity. The gods can become quite human-like sometimes, and she asks Diana to forgive them as they were too busy arguing amongst themselves and could not warn her about Circe. When Diana did find out about Circe, they chose not to help, but it was decision that wasn’t meant to be taken lightly. Hippolyta, angry, steps forward and asks why they did not help her daughter. Athena explains that the cosmic migration is the only thing that matters right now, and until a new order is established, no contact between the human and gods can happen. Diana then asks why they have been summoned here. Hermes replies that they need to destroy the mountain they once saved and they want the Amazons to help in their desertion of the worshippers. They choose the queen to decide, but she replies that it is not <em>her</em> choice, but <em>their</em> choice. Through Apollo’s orb, hundreds of Amazon faces look up and Hippolyta calls for their vote. Their bracelets clink together and Hippolyta turns to the gods say that the Amazons will always stand by them. Hippolyta then asks Hercules what is going to happen and he explains that he can still have faith in the gods and ironically, Hippolyta says that they are praying for the death of the mountain. Hercules replies that the mountain is dying, and it will only do them good if it was destroyed, once and for all. Once they have found a new Olympus, the gods will return. Despite Hermes accusations, Hercules tells her that he would never betray her again and would rather have his eyes plucked. Hippolyta then asks where Diana is and Hercules tells her that she is with Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and that Diana is the key to all this.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the centre of the mountain, Zeus explains how her bracelets came about. They are taken from the remains of the Aegis shield which was formed from the great hide of a goat called Amaltheia who had taken care of Zeus when he was an infant and provided enough energy for Olympus to exist and only two people were to ever hold the shield, and one of them was his father, Chronus. When Zeus defeated his father, he gave it to his daughter Athena and she had Hephaestus re-forge it into a prize to be awarded to the mightiest of the Amazons. The Amazons below are chanting their prayers and the gods can feel electricity surging through and with the gods combined energy, Diana will have to block it with her bracelets. When she does deflect it, it will make contact with Amaltheia's legacy and it will create a bolt that must be directed to the three Gods’ crossed sceptres. With the chorus of prayer, a flame begins to create itself and through the cracks of the mountain as it heads directly for her and with her bracelets, she deflects it towards the three sceptres. It strikes, and the force is amplified. Diana strains as her skin begins to crack and blister. Finally, the mountain succumbs and Mount Olympus explodes with a blinding white light. The smoke clears and the three Amazons find themselves back in Themyscira and Menalippe cries out she can no longer feel the gods presence. Hippolyta says that from this day on, it is not their turn to determine their fate and tomorrow shall be the day to decide whether Man should set on Paradise Island.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>First $1.00 issue.</li></ul>",,,,,,,False,30151,"{'icon_url':

Hellene had forgiven Hercules for a long time now, but once again, she dreads the day that Man would walk on Paradise Island and she feels that she is not a true Amazon for doing so. Diana tells her that she is smart enough; she is not a mindless zombie who just walks into their own death. Amazons also have the right to fear and express their fears, and Hellene has done very well in doing so.</p><p>In New Hampshire in a national park, a backpacker is under a tree, sleeping. Suddenly the air is strong and a strong light blazes into the woods. The backpacker wakes up to see what it is and sees a shadow in front of the light and reveals to be a doppelganger of the hiker!</p><p>The last time Vanessa and her friend, Eileen spoke over the phone, Eileen said that Barry is only using Vanessa to get to Wonder Woman, but Vanessa, against Eileen’s wishes is still determined to talk to Barry. He has been avoiding Vanessa for some reason and she wants to know why. They turn a corner and see Barry and Vanessa calls out to him but as she’s getting closer to him, she sees another girl, Lucy Spears with Barry who is new in school and showing her around. Vanessa asks if she can speak with him for a few minutes but he says he is busy and that they can talk later. What else could go wrong? The fact that Barry is off with the new “little Miss Pom Pom” and she has also flunked geometry. Just then, another boy walks by Vanessa and tells her that her mum, Julia is getting friendly with the geometry teacher. Julia and Mr. Westlake talk under a tree and was meaning to talk to Julia about Vanessa’s study habits, but has been very busy lately. He understands that Vanessa is associated with Wonder Woman and asks how Julia has time for herself. She replies that when Wonder Woman is around, they study together and Vanessa’s grades shoot up. This gives Julia time to read, write and knit. Mr. Westlake then asks Julia about her social time and she gets the feeling that it isn’t about Vanessa’s grades anymore. He blushes and apologises but she replies that she is actually flattered. She then asks him if he wants to take her out on a date and he replies with a sheepish “Yes” but before they can continue, Vanessa interrupts and says she is ready to go home. Mr. Westlake says that now is maybe not the best time, and Julia, frustrated, put her hands on her hips and asks if he wants to go out with her or not! He stammers that he does and arranges to meet next Saturday to a nice restaurant. She then asks what his first name is, and he says “Horace”. In the car, Vanessa is watching as she groans.</p><p>Meanwhile, in another are of Boston amongst the new rows of townhouses built after Decay’s destruction, one of the houses are empty. Suddenly, one of the rooms, a woman appears out of nowhere ""By all of Chronus, I've done it,"" she says. Whoever has been here is the woman that she searches for. But there is no time for memories, she must find her or everyone is doomed!</p><p>On the Boston roads, Julia and Vanessa are stuck in traffic. Does going out with Horace bother Vanessa? She replies that the last thing he needs is for them two to gang up on her, and besides, he’s fat and bald. Julia tells Vanessa that when you get people get older, there is more than just physical appearances and he is actually a very intelligent and caring man. They don’t all look like Barry. Vanessa scolds her mother for mentioning that creep. Julia asks what has happened and if she wants to talk about it, but Vanessa snaps back “Leave me alone!” Julia lectures her for being so rude and although she can understand why she is upset but it is no excuse to be like that. Vanessa apologises and Julia says she has had rotten boyfriends during her age too. Suddenly, they realise that the cars and people around then are disappearing and find Diana lifting up the car.</p><p>Meanwhile, a lone figure looks through some binoculars and many memories return as he watches the red, blue and gold costumed Amazon. He then feels a tap on his shoulder by a police officer where a group of tourists report that he had scared them out of the shrine. He ignores the police officer grabs his attention by grabbing his shoulder and as he turns around, his eyes are burning and the tourists run as fast as they can.</p><p>At the Kapatelis house, Diana brings the car down near the house and an overjoyed Vanessa leaps into Diana’s arms. Diana apologises if she has frightened them, but she wanted to talk to them as soon as possible. And then, she asks the question: if they would like to come to Themyscira. Julia realises that the cultural exchange went Diana’s way and it is up to her to decide who will set foot on Themyscira first. Vanessa is very excited about this and asks when they will go, and Diana replies this weekend. Vanessa tells her mother that it looks like she will have to cancel her date and she cannot wait to tell Lucy Spears about this. As Vanessa bounces back in the house, Diana asks if this is in anyway inconvenient as she heard something about Mr. Westlake, and Julia replies that it is okay. He will understand about this unique educational opportunity. Diana then launches herself in the air and says that she needs to see someone special at the Hanscom Air Force. At the base, General Hillary’s aide comes in and tells him that Wonder Woman is here to see him. Hillary’s aide greets Wonder Woman with a handshake and she asks where she can find Etta Candy, but he recommends speaking with the General first. She asks the General if he knows where Etta Candy is, but Hillary says that she is on a confidential mission and her whereabouts cannot be revealed. Wonder Woman asks if she will be back by the weekends and Hillary replies that she won’t. Wonder Woman leaves and Hillary’s aide apologises for letting Wonder Woman in as she looked quite determined. Hillary says that Wonder Woman comes from a warrior race who understands the call of duty.</p><p>The doppelganger of the hiker watches as the glowing orb flies through the sky and the hiker’s eyes glow for a moment when the orb hits the man with the binoculars. The stranger’s eyes then glow too as the orb continues once again and across the sky, the cloaked woman sees it pass over her and the orb then flies down to her. She runs down the street as it chases her and she leaps over a railing, but the orb is catching up to her. The orb strikes its target and it seems as if they just vaporise, leaving a pile of ash. But behind the tree, it seems as if the cloaked woman has managed to evade it and the orb flies off overhead.</p><p>It’s Friday night and Diana tries to get in contact with Steve Trevor. All she has been able to contact was his answering machine. She leaves another message and says that she, Julia and Vanessa will be back next week. Diana puts the phone down and Julia asks if she has been able to contact Steve. Disappointed, Diana shakes her head and Julia tells her that it has been a very short notice. Diana says that it would have been a great honour for him to meet her mother and her Amazon sisters. Julia suggests that maybe she should postpone it, but Diana replies that that is unfair, seeing as she is so excited. Anyway, Steve and Etta can come next time. They step out on the veranda and she says she should return home to help with the preparations. Julia explains how she is very grateful for letting them on Paradise Island and Diana replies how she has been her wise mentor. Julia stares up into the sky and flying through the sky is Diana, who presents peace, love and is majestic and beautiful at the same time. Julia cannot wait for the next day and she too will be allowed to journey through destiny’s door.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>On page 17 panel 4 General Hillary's first name was Thomas as

Vanessa is taking up all the attention, signing issues of ""The World Today"" with Hippolyta and Diana on the front. Eileen and Meekins watch from the distance as they comment on Vanessa saying that she has no time for the little people. Just then, Lucy Spears appears and asks Eileen if she can go get her copy signed by Vanessa. Eileen snaps at the blonde girl especially since she stole Vanessa’s boyfriend. Lucy, confused asks what she is talking about as Barry had told her that Vanessa was nothing but a <i>friend</i> to him. Suddenly, realising she has been duped by him and Lucy goes off in a rush to find Barry. Vanessa then wanders over to Eileen followed by her fans and Eileen asks if she is ready to leave now. Vanessa tells her that she has been invited over to a party with Joanne Albert who has horses. There’s no room in the car so Eileen will have to stay behind. Vanessa then tells Eileen she will make up for it next week with a movie.</p><p>Meanwhile across time, the backpacker is standing by a newsstand reading it and the owner of the newsstand is annoyed with him, asking if he is going to pay for it. The backpacker replies that he didn’t think he would need money. The owner attempts to man handle him, but he is sent flying at a wave of energy from the backpacker’s hand. He apologises for hurting him and will help him if he needs it. He then coughs out some coins onto the pavement. A police officer then comes by and confronts the backpacker. The officer asks if he is out of town, and the backpacker replies that he is <i>very</i> out of time. Suddenly, the backpacker is surrounded by light.</p><p>On TVs across the nation, there are live reports of Wonder Woman giving a speech to an assembly. Speaking on behalf of her mother, Princess Diana says that Themyscira is now open to the rest of the world. She says ""Too long have the weeds of fear and distrust been allowed to strangle our world's garden. No longer must the sins of the past taint our hopes for the future. My mother, Queen Hippolyta, has charged me with the holy duty of selecting those who will represent Patriarch's World as the next wave in what I hope will be a continuous tide of cultural exchange and mutual enlightenment. I pray I am worthy of that trust as the Ambassador to your world, my duty is to demonstrate the sincerity of my nation's goals: to teach, and to learn; to live together peacefully, and to honour all equally; to understand compassionately, and to love unequivocally. I've grown to cherish this new world, and all of you. Despite all our differences, I fervently believe that the age of Global Communion is just beyond the horizon."" It then goes live to the U.N. where Wonder Woman has not yet talked to the press. Her speech has had mixed reactions, and particularly negative comments that come from the Middle East. The reported continues how more talks in the future that should… Wonder Woman appears and the press swarm around her, where she is bombarded with questions as the press usually do. She then pauses and she sense something is not right, yet she has felt this before. She sees a figure wearing a Grecian hood and she somehow knows that stranger. The stranger replies that it may be that Wonder Woman is the chosen one. Wonder Woman’s eyes then widen when the stranger looks at a picture of a girl and realises that Wonder Woman is not the one she is looking for. Diana pushes her way through the crowd and pushes everyone out of the way in pursuit of the strange woman. She then sees the figure disappear (the identity is revealed in <i>The New Titans</i> #50). The reporter then rushes up to Wonder Woman and asks about the one with the “winged helmet”. Hearing this, her eyes widen and she flies up into the sky. The reporter comments how Wonder Woman is still puzzling as ever and at the same time, she is flying over Boston to New York. She arrives and finds Hermes who has come to help her with her mission of Proselytism. Wonder Woman asks why he is here but not with the other gods. He replies that he tried to reason with the gods but they would not listen. How can Man be expected to know that the gods exist when they haven’t even seen them and gestures to the crowds watching from below. He then removes his helmet and tips it upside down, where gold and diamonds fall to the ground. Diana asks how someone can purchase the value of faith and Hermes replies that he merely getting their attention.</p><p>Suddenly, a gun shot is fired and everyone scrambles. They see a getaway car and a boy who has been shot two times in the chest. As Hermes pursues the robbers, Diana and paramedics tend to the boy. In the car, the two robbers hear a little voice and coming from the bag. They open it to find Hermes inside. He tells them that God of Thieves may appreciate them, but they should never steal from Hermes himself! He then waves his hands and the road in front of the car starts peeling like a banana and the car slams into a wall of tarmac and injuring the two robbers badly. The boy’s condition is hopeless when Hermes arrives and forms a glow around the boy’s body. The boy is completely healed and stands up. “Mr. Hermes” was happy to talk to the reporters but then he was pulled aside by Wonder Woman and talked him into going with her to heal the robbers, who were then placed in custody.</p><p>Back at the Kapatelis' home, they watch the report on the news and Julia tells her daughter to turn it off. Hermes asks why and Diana says that she is very melancholic. Meanwhile, Vanessa asks Hermes if he can bring up anything and replies with a “Yes.” She then quickly follows up with another question, asking him if he knows what a Video Entertainment Centre is. Julia tells Vanessa to call her friend Eileen because she has apparently been calling for her all night. Vanessa goes upstairs in a mood and Hermes asks Julia why she is so annoyed. She replies that with all due respect, she would like it if he did not buy her daughter’s loyalty. It’s hard enough being a mother when you’re competing with an Olympian Santa Clause. Hermes frowns and asks if she is mocking him. Diana tries to calm things down, but Julia replies back to Hermes saying that his faith is where it can be sold to the highest bidder. Hermes replies that she has a fire in her heart which he admires, but history has shown that reward is the cornerstone of faith and asks her “Youth and beauty perhaps?” She glares at him and exclaims “No deal!” saying that what he talks is ransom and not reward. Is this how the gods work now? The gods have to barter what faith they cannot earn? Hermes eyes narrow and Diana explains that Julia meant no offence. She says that Julia has taught her a lot about humanity and Julia asks Diana not to “beg”. Hermes can then see that Julia is jealous as the time of her being a mentor has ended. He then realises that this is her home and he will not stay where he is welcome. Diana must come with him. Vanessa who has been listening upstairs comes out of her room and yells a “No!” Diana explains that while she does not want to leave, she must because she owes him a duty because without him, she would not exist. Hermes suggests that Julia does not force him to take Diana away from her as long as she does question his authority, and Julia replies that she cannot do that. Hermes then raises his hand and changes Diana’s costume to a Grecian robe and says that they are now ready to part. Diana tells Vanessa and Julia that she loves them but she must do what her duty calls her to and with that, a blinding light fills the room and they disappear. There is silence once more where Julia looks up to her daughter and her eyes fill with hatred as Vanessa turns into her room and slams the door.</p><p>A week later, Horace and Julia are having lunch together when Horace is reading the front page about Hermes and Diana. Hermes claims he can do anything except raise the dead. She replies ""Yes, but only temporarily, unless you sell your soul to him."" She explains how she is worried for Diana and how Hermes has a grip on her. She continues, saying that the god has seemed to convert Vanessa with his ability to conjure up anything and Horace adds that Vanessa seems to be lacking motivation. Julia puts her head in her hands and tells Horace that Diana is a grown woman. Maybe Diana doesn’t need her anymore. Just then, a glow fills the skies and everyone looks up, and it is Hermes along with Diana. Hermes asks her if she can feel the worship and uses his staff to listen to the conversation below, but all they can hear is ""Do you think they'll toss us some more gold?"", ""I don't trust them. They're trying to take over,” and ""I heard that Hermes is a fake, just like the Wonder Woman broad."" Diana asks him to stop as they fear that the god’s goal is to rule the world. He smiles and say that they are gods but she reminds him that she is <i>not</i> a god, that she is just like them. He replies that she is much better than that. Diana asks that teaching love, peace and equality is the greatest journey of all and that is her destiny, surely. Hermes realises that he has gone to fast and Diana clearly needs to think this through. He instructs her to fly to his temple, but Hermes has to deal with these people below. Diana flies off and Hermes damn to gods for wasting such a potential. He flies down to the crowds and asks what he can do for them today. Meanwhile, a shadowy figure is watching from afar and the woman then goes to Hermes and addresses in classical Greek. Hermes is impressed that she can speak his native tongue and introduces herself as Eury. For centuries they have been waiting for this and finally, she has realised her family’s dream. She says that her father is dying and that he needs healing. He lifts himself and Eury into the air and will not only save his father, but make him a god too! He instructs the news crew to follow him as he makes his way there.</p><p>A while later, the news crew catch up to them in an alley and they make their way to a doorway and the soundman says to the cameraman that there is something strange about this building. Hermes assures them that there is nothing to worry about, and they are under the care of Hermes. Eury leads them to a cellar where an old man lays in bed and Eury begs Hermes to hurry as he does not have much time left. He holds out his Caduceus and instructs the old man to hold it but has he does, Hermes lets out a cry and the crew watches as Hermes is surrounded by energy. Realising something is wrong, he removes Eury’s sunglasses and instantly turns into stone and the terrified cameraman drops his camera and runs. Eury pushes over the petrified man and he shatters in a thousand pieces and Hermes asks who they are. The old man transforms himself in Phobos and Eury reveals herself to be Euryale and he realises that he has been lured into a trap. Hermes then hears his name being called and looks up to a massive stone figure. ""It cannot be! Not after all these Eons! Ixion the Assassin!""</p>",,,,,,,False,30410,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58234/8357226-wonder_woman_2_23.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",23,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/massachusetts/4020-55745/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-41183/', 'id': 41183, 'name': 'New York City', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-city/4020-41183/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56310/', 'id': 56310, 'name': 'New York State', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-york-state/4020-56310/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56629/', 'id': 56629, 'name': 'United Nations Headquarters', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/united-nations-headquarters/4020-56629/'}]",A God Among Men,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41435/', 'id': 41435, 'name': 'Lasso of Truth', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51517/', 'id': 51517, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Bracelets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-bracelets/4055-51517/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56852/', 'id': 56852, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Earrings"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-earrings/4055-56852/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51489/', 'id': 51489, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Tiara"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-50470/', 'id': 50470, 'name': 'Art Young', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/art-young/4040-50470/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2913/', 'id': 2913, 'name': 'George Pérez', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/george-perez/4040-2913/', 'role': 'writer, artist, penciler, inker, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43437/', 'id': 43437, 'name': 'Karen Berger', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/karen-berger/4040-43437/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-8294/', 'id': 8294, 'name': 'Tatjana Wood', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tatjana-wood/4040-8294/', 'role': 'colorist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-5351/', 'id': 5351, 'name': 'Will Blyberg', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/will-blyberg/4040-5351/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman-23-a-god-among-men/4000-30410/,,[],[],[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-3824/', 'id': 3824, 'name': 'Wonder Woman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman/4050-3824/'}"

Analysts are studying the film they are provided with to see if this is a hoax or not. At the scene, two policemen find the camera lying on the ground, and then they hear something that sparks their attention and see the cameraman cowering in the corner. They calm him down and he babbles something about the soundman saying that this building was strange. One officer assumes he is high on drugs, but the other officer agrees with him, as this really is an empty lot. Meanwhile, under the building is Ixion who is chained to a stone wheel. Hermes still recognises him after he had put him away many, many years ago. Hermes is then confused with how Ixion managed to escape, and Phobos replies that when the gods were too busy with cosmic migration and that it was simple as sneaking in into the Underworld and snatching him there. However, he could only take him away from the torture, not the chains and since Hermes was the one that forged them, only he can break them. Hermes tell them that they will pay for this and Phobos gloats that now he has the Caduceus, he can undo what Hermes had done to Ixion and blasts an energy bolt towards him. The ground above shake as the two officers and cameraman can feel it. One of the officers enters the building and finds Euryale, who immediately turns him into stone. Ixion then breaks the chains he was once imprisoned by and another camera person captures Ixion rising up from the building.</p><p>Vanessa, who is watching, stares in horror as the events unfold. She runs downstairs to Julia and Horace who are drinking coffee and excitedly yells what is happening. Julia calmly replies that it should wait until later, but Vanessa grabs the remote and turns of the TV. Julia jumps out of her chair, shocked, to find that it is Phobos, who once tried to kill her.</p><p>At the scene, Phobos tells the onlookers that they will die as Ixion stands over them with Hermes in his grip. As the police arrive, the captain speaks into a loud speaker to give up Hermes, but Euryale just laughs and petrifies the captain. The police, meanwhile, stand in awe as Ixion lumbers to them. Hermes pleads for him to not harm any mortals. The police fire upon him, but bullets are useless and Ixion lifts his foot and stomps down on them. He laughs and it echoes across the city as civilians flee. The camera person is still filming and her producers tell her to get out of there, but it is too late as Euryale does her stuff and Ixion slams down his foot, shattering her to pieces.</p><p>Meanwhile, Julia is in shock from seeing Phobos and screams for the television to be turned off. Where’s Diana when they need her?</p><p>Hermes is still being held in Ixion’s hand and he goes stronger each time he kills an innocent. The only reason why Ixion is holding Hermes in his hand is that so he can witness each death in horror. Hermes much read his Caduceus, as that is the only hope left.</p><p>Miles away, Diana is in New Hampshire where Hermes took his mortal form and had built a temple for himself. Diana is taking a swim and relaxing, when Hermes appears as Diana asks what is wrong. He says that Boston is under attack by Ixion and many are already dead. She instantly shoots up from the water and grabbing her armour and changing into it then swiftly taking to the skies.</p><p>Somewhere else on a small island in the South Pacific, Etta Candy monitors her console and calls over her senior officer, telling him that she has found a transmission. She has decoded it and she shows her senior officer. Suddenly, he takes an interest and he has been in the air force long enough to know what that is. It’s an invasion!</p><p>In Boston, Ixion is still rampaging around with Phobos sitting on his shoulders, but suddenly a punch from Wonder Woman sends him flying. Wonder Woman wraps her lasso around him and tells him that with this, he will no longer spew lies. Phobos replies that she killed his brother Deimos, and for that, many mortals will die. Nearby, Ixion lifts up some kind of frigate and Hermes watches in guilt, but then Wonder Woman snatches the vessel and places it back in the water and Hermes yells out to her, telling her to concentrate on getting the Caduceus and she replies that she doesn’t know where she is, and looking for it may cost her. She has no choice but to attack Ixion. With that, she launches herself at Ixion but she is swatted away like a fly and comes to her senses just before she flies into a building and she realises that she needs to get Ixion onto open ground so then she can fight him without any complications. Before Ixion can react, she lifts him up and he lets go of Hermes. There she carries the closet open ground and thinks Gayhead Cliffs and slams him into the red cliff. She hovers over him, wondering if she threw too hard, but then a hand tries to grab her but she evades just in time. She punches him and he starts throwing boulders at her as he rages that he will not be taken back by Hades.</p><p>Back in Boston, the National Guard open fire on Phobos as he calls for help from Euryale. She emerges and asks him who tied him up and he replies it was Wonder Woman. Phobos swears that Wonder Woman will be tortured for his and Euryale begins to undo the lasso as another weak hand reaches for the Caduceus. Euryale sees the movement but is too late as she is killed by a blast of energy which decapitates her. Hermes stands over Phobos and he asks them to hold their fire and turns to Phobos, saying that he has underestimated him. When Ixion had let go, he managed to make his way through the city’s sewers and he points the glowing Caduceus at Phobos, threatening him to tell him what he needs to know unless he wants to suffer a more horrible death than the Gorgon could ever execute.</p><p>At Gayhead Cliffs, Ixion is slammed against the cliffs as Wonder Woman tells him that she can feel his strength fading. He is no longer a match for her, and he should just surrender. He replies that he would rather not go back to torture and would rather die. Just then, Hermes appears with Phobos following him, still bound. He continues how Phobos has helped him find the right punishment for Ixion and then he raises his Caduceus in which the serpents coiled around it come to life and he tells Ixion that he should prepare to return to inferno and Ixion begs for him to be killed, and Hermes tells him that his torture has just begun. He is chained to the Great Wheel once again and screams as he knows that he is bound for all eternity. A confused Wonder Woman says that Tartarus has been absorbed in the cosmic migration and questions where the Great Wheel will be placed and Phobos tells Hermes to reveal where Ixion is imprisoned. ""Tell the pathetic fool that all her sisterhood's sacrifices have been for nothing, that the Assassin must be placed beneath her beloved Paradise Island - making it a fortress once more."" Wonder Woman is shocked, and Hermes apologises but once the new Olympus has been formed, he will be kept in Tartarus once again. She asks how long that will be as the Amazons have made many plans and says that surely there is an alternative and it was Hermes who freed him in the first place! Hermes begs Wonder Woman to calm down and reminds her that even the gods are not infallible. She replies that the Amazons are not infallible either. For centuries she has been told to suffer for her own sins, and now they must suffer for the gods’ sins? That is not fair! Then, air force jets fly near the fight and the squadron leader tells them to hold their fire as it seems that the situation is under control. Just then, the impossible seems to have come true as Ixion breaks from his chains. As Ixion goes for the jets, Wonder Woman prepares to attack him but Hermes holds her back and tells her that she had prayed for an alternative and the fates have provided her one. Wonder Woman watches as Ixion lifts up a huge chunk of the cliff and prepares the hurl it to the jets. But they open fire as Ixion’s screams fill the night. Wonder Woman becomes a statue upon hearing those screams and she wishes to intercede, but every fibre in her body is telling her not to, for these are the screams of relief as this marks the end of Ixion and he has paid his final penance.</p><p>Later at the Kapatelis home, Julia and Vanessa watch as Ixion’s body falls and the news reader begins to report how many have been killed as the number is in the hundreds now. Only Wonder Woman stopped the numbers from increasing and the police are also tracking down a man who calls himself Hermes as he was the last one seen carrying the alleged mastermind. Vanessa asks her mother if Diana is OK and Diana has in fact been watching them and reassures that she is fine. Vanessa is overjoyed and asks where Hermes is and she replies that she does not know. Julia then asks Vanessa to leave for a moment as the two of them have to talk for a bit. Vanessa goes up to her room, and Diana apologises for putting Julia in such a confrontational position with Hermes. Julia reassures her that nothing is wrong, and apologises again as she let Hermes cloud her judgement. Even though every instinct told her that Julia was right, she just couldn’t go against the gods. Julia then tells her that it wasn’t Diana <em>or</em> Hermes and she guesses that the Amazons have never gone through menopause and Diana replies that she has read about it. Julia hugs Diana and tells her that if she dares to leave, she will tie her in her own lasso! From upstairs Vanessa watches the two women hug and tears rolls down her face as that is true friendship and Diana warns that things are going to get much tougher. Julia replies that they will get through it together and she asks if Hermes is OK. Diana says he should’ve been back by now and prays that nothing has gone wrong. Outside the house, Hermes listens in and he hears Julia tell Diana that he needs time. He is probably suffering from guilt and shame and Diana adds that she probably shouldn’t have lectured him. Julia, surprised, says that Hermes must have taken a hard hit if he were to be lectured by Diana and Diana nods. Julia replies that she can imagine, as she has seen the way he looks at her. Diana quickly replies that their relationship is not like that at all but Julia asks her if she sure that Hermes knows that for a fact and Diana replies that he must because he is a god.</p><p>""Yes sweetheart,"" Hermes hears Julia softly reply, ""but remember... even a God can be all too human."" Hermes leaves, with Julia’s words in his head.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>An <a href=""https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invasion/4050-4197/""

own against the aliens. Diana bands with the Justice League International to stem the tide of invasion.</em></p><p>In the South Pacific in the military tracking station, she had decoded a strange transmission. Five minutes later, she had told her superior and soon was surrounded in energy. Four minutes later, her superior was killed and the station was destroyed and now, she is seen running for her life. She finds a radio where she can call for help. She tells the operator that she has some important files with her, and the operator asks for her location. Etta replies that she can’t because the enemy is listening in and she has to keep moving. Suddenly, she stops and can hear the operator stop in mid-sentence with an “Oh my God!” and suddenly an explosion can be heard and the other line is dead.</p><p>Meanwhile in Themyscira, Pythia and Euboea are riding their horses when the sky seems conjuring up a storm, yet there are no clouds in the sky. Menalippe is screaming for the noises to stop, and Hippolyta summons her daughter. When she arrives, Menalippe thanks the gods and asks Diana if she can hear them. They must be stopped. Menalippe is saying that they must not cross the Chaos. Wonder Woman steps forward and holds Menalippe’s hand and it feels like she’s having a fever, and Hippolyta thought she was just communicating with the gods though she’s never reacted like this. Wonder Woman also comments that it had started when that “storm” had started. Wonder Woman says that the Chaos is in fact a divine portal – and that someone is trying to breach it. Wonder Woman then flies above her home and finds three alien ships behind her. What could these aliens possibly want?</p><p>On board a ship, one of the crew members asks for further orders. Just then, Wonder Woman’s image comes up on their display screen and the commander tells the crew that she must be destroyed. The officers prepare the weapons and fire a blast of energy that hits an unprepared Wonder Woman. With the divine portal still open, the three ships move forward, but only the lead ship moves forward. However, they are still in contact with their leader and he orders them to finish off Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman apologises to the gods for letting herself fall into the alien’s trap and for allowing them to invade her home. However, Wonder Woman doesn’t take kindly to invaders and she desperately out-flies the invaders. She then suddenly stops to have a look at the vessels and realise that the aliens piloting the vessels have wings and bird-shaped elements and they are just like the ones that Hawkman wears – which means they are Thanagarian. She prepares herself for another attack and deflects their energy blasts. It bounces off and hits another ship. The commander continues the pursuit but he crashes into another vessel as both ships are destroyed. She dives through the portal. Through the other side of the portal and she sees the Thanagarian warship trapped by strong wings. She ties her lasso to one of its wings and she yells at the craft, asking them not to resist. She can feel they are panicking as their emotions course through the lasso and she begs for them to listen to her but they blast her again with their energy blasts. Wonder Woman releases the grip on her lasso and the ship itself gets sucked into the vortex until it explodes. She is frustrated with their refusal to listen, but the emotion she felt through her lasso, she knows that an attack on Paradise Island is inevitable.</p><p>On Man’s World, Etta Candy is running for her life as everywhere she goes, there are explosions. She risks herself by pausing for them as they say that she must remain still so they can get a fix on where she is but she replies that the aliens will home in on her position. That becomes true as a nearby explosion causes her to become unconscious.</p><p>In Massachusetts in the Kapatelis house, General Hillary, Steve Trevor, Julia, Vanessa and Black Canary are waiting for Wonder Woman. Hillary impatiently asks where she is and she comes in and Black Canary tells her that she has contacted Justice League International like she has requested and it seems as if they have already been investigating other invasions. General Hillary continues that from his sources, the attack on Paradise Island was not an accident and that they have had reports from all over. Hillary unrolls a map and says that where it is marked red is where Etta Candy was hit last. Wonder Woman fears for her, but Canary assures her that she is fine. She is then asked to meet with JLI as this isn’t something she can handle alone. She doesn’t understand, and he tells her that this attack is of global proportions. Wonder Woman says goodbye as she flies to meet with other superheroes while Steve and Canary are off to their own plans. Wonder Woman shouts back to Steve that she will save Etta and tries to comprehend all that is happening. When will it end? She soon arrives in Fiji where she meets up with the JLI. Fire thinks it is pathetic that they drool over the Amazon hussy like that, but Ice replies that she is no hussy! It is not her fault that she can reduce men to teenagers. She meets up with Martian Manhunter and they go into the tent where there is a platoon officer waiting for them. The officer explains that she is Khunds territory alone. Manhunter doesn’t understand why the JLI is needed and the officer responds that she has broken the code as she is carrying intelligence on the enemy and it is important that she needs to be rescued, and that’s what Wonder Woman is for. He asks what the JLI is needed for and she replies that they need to keep the forces busy while she attempts the rescue. Wonder Woman also asks him if she can borrow a few of the JLI members as these Khunds are a total mystery to her. Manhunter briefs his team and tells them that Wonder Woman needs two volunteers. Blue Beetle steps forward immediately, but Manhunter says that he has a job for him. Guy Gardener then counts himself <em>out</em> as he would rather be in the action than help a pacifist. Wonder Woman replies that she may be a pacifist, but she is a warrior, and she is a warrior indeed. He snaps back with ""Hey, no offence Wonder Babe, but I know all about you"" and Rocket Red butts in reminding Guy that he has read all the battles that Wonder Woman has been through. Wonder Woman thanks Rocket Red for his support. He adds that he would be happy tot help Wonder Woman and Fire and Ice nominate Wonder Woman’s next volunteer: Guy Gardener, by pushing him forward. With her team, Green Lantern asks what their plan is, and she tells him that they have to rescue Etta with as little as bloodshed as possible. Guy responds that they shouldn’t be worrying too much about <em>their</em> blood. Wonder Woman replies that there is hopefully a way to reason with the Khunds and Guy replies that there is only <em>one</em> way to reason with them. With that, he uses his ring to smashes the lead craft. Wonder Woman shouts for him to stop, but he replies that there is only one way to do this. The vessel begins to fall and she uses her lasso to tie him up and asks what sort of barbarian he is and that he could have restrained the craft. Meanwhile, Rocket Red goes for the second vessel, assuring Wonder Woman that he will capture it, but because he had his new armor on, he mistakes his blasters for the tractor beam and striking the vessel causes him to fly backwards and he lands near the first vessel that was destroyed. The Khunds then surround him, ready to take him down. In the sky, Green Lantern tells Wonder Woman about his philosophy, that you have to ""Get them before they get you!"" Below, Etta can see Wonder Woman and has to shout out to her, even though it is a big risk.</p><p>Rocket Red finds himself surrounded by Khund troops but protects himself with a force field and returns fire. Green Lantern tells Wonder Woman to release him as she does not have the guts to get into a fight. She tells him not to push her when she hears a cry down below and sees Etta waving her hands. Green Lantern is saying that ""stupid broad is making herself a target"" as Wonder Woman is annoyed with herself as she had been too busy arguing with Guy. Meanwhile, a Khund ship spots Etta and goes in for the kill. The energy beams is getting closer as she tries to outrun it. Wonder Woman zooms down but it seems as if a beam has directly struck her. Suddenly, she sees a force field surround her and Green Lantern tells Wonder Woman that he “has his moments.” However, a Khund vessel is going for Guy when Wonder Woman charges for it head first and the vessel flies out of control and falls into a nearby ocean, and Guy and Etta watch as it disintegrates in the ocean. Guy is impressed as she had killed and she replies that she feared for his life and that is what any Amazon would do. Wonder Woman hugs Etta and Guy tells them that they need to get back quickly. Wonder Woman asks Etta if she is okay, and she replies that she is fine, but then adds that all this would be nothing if the intelligence papers are ruined as she fell in a marsh. But Wonder Woman reassures her that it is okay, that it wouldn’t have been for nothing as Etta is alive. Just then, Rocket Red appears with two Khund prisoners and says that these two might be able to help.</p><p>Back at the camp, the platoon officer is congratulating Martian Manhunter for his work and his team for destroying the Khunds that were occupying the area. However, he replies that there is no pride in war or slaughter. Wonder Woman then charges in the tent, asking how Etta is doing and the officer replies that she is doing fine. The two heroes ask if that is all but the officer replies that unfortunately, it is not, as they will be needed in the future. Outside, Wonder Woman tells Martian Manhunter of the conversation he had with the officer. He replies that the Khunds themselves are human beings, and it is wrong to celebrate death, and she agrees, but what choice do they have? He agrees and asks why they have to take such pleasure in killing.

Martian Manhunter thinks that Wonder Woman would certainly make a nice addition to the JLI as she had shown great skill in battle when it was needed. Even Green Lantern agrees as he admits that she wasn’t the “bleeding heart” that he thought she was. Diana says that it is nice to find people who have the same “uniqueness” as her. Maybe they will consider coming over to Themyscira one day? Arriving in Boston, she flies over the city and looks at the destruction caused while fighting Ixion. Some people are saying that it’s her fault that this destruction was caused, but then again if it wasn’t for her, Ixion would probably have totally destroyed this city. It may have not been Hermes’ fault, but she certainly hopes that they will be able to forgive him... and her.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Perdition’s Pit, Hermes asks for forgiveness and sits next to Phobos who is now entombed in a stone. Hermes asks himself how he could be fooled by someone like <i>Phobos</i>. Hermes would have killed him if it wasn’t his fault. He then hears a voice and looks up. It is Harmonia, Ares’ daughter. She tells Hermes not to pity her brother. He then tells her not to try and save her brother and she assures him that that is not what she’s here for. Hermes has the right to imprison Phobos because how things are created and how things work in the world can be interfered with by gods. With that, Hermes’ godly powers have allowed his ego to grow. The humans don’t just allow higher entities to rule as the higher entity must earn respect from them. The Gods cannot afford to lose anymore worshippers, especially the Amazons and Diana.</p><p>At the Hansom Air Force Base, Wonder Woman touches down the same time as Etta is in the helicopter. Wonder Woman asks her if she is better and she replies that she is looking forward to seeing Steve. They are then driven to General Hillary’s office and Etta asks if something is wrong. Captain Atom steps forward with “I’m afraid so Lt. Candy.” He says he has some bad news about Steve Trevor. He then explains what happens, as an alien race called the Durlan had been an imposter, posing as Steve and the real one has gone missing (<a href=""https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-atom-24-war-day/4000-30509/"" data-ref-id=""4000-30509""><i>Captain Atom</i> #24</a>) and Etta starts crying. Hillary assures Etta that they are doing all they can and he then picks up the phone and calls General Eiling at the Invasion Command Centre. Eiling picks up, and asks his one of his aides that Gaffney is not responding to their calls. The fact that he was also <i>very</i> eager to do this mission was very suspicious. The aide then queries for the last location of Gaffney’s location, and he was 20 miles off-track. They discuss whether Gaffney may have crashed. Just then, a picture of him, dead, shows up on the screens located a few miles away from the base. He apparently has been dead for days and they have been tricked by another Durlan… again! Hillary requests the plotted flight path and find that the Durlan came from Cuba. Before Hillary can push out a word, Captain Atom and Wonder Woman are flying towards Steve’s co-ordinates.</p><p>Back at Boston, Hermes appears near the ruins and the citizens there are certainly not happy to see him. He tells the people that he knows that he has caused much pain and destruction and did it because of his own ego. Even though he cannot bring back the lost loved ones, he can bring back the city. This is projected live across the state as Julia and Vanessa are watching at home. Vanessa asks if he can pull this off, and Julia replies that hopefully he can, though she feels that their forgiveness towards him is only because he grants them to. He raises his Caduceus and does his magic.</p><p>Over the Atlantic, the Durlon is flying towards his destination and says into the radio that it is now time to attack with the main armada and requests new orders. Steve Trevor has a strong will, as they have tortured him and yet he gives false information but they need him for victory. The Durlon then picks something up on his radar. He turns around to see Wonder Woman and Captain Atom tailing him very closely as the heroes cannot allow him to escape because they need to location of Steve Trevor. With that, Captain Atom places his hand on the plane’s fuselage and absorbs all the energy, dramatically slowing the plane down and starts spiralling. She goes under the plane and grabs it careering towards a safe landing, but later they find that the plane has no one on board. Captain Atom reminds Wonder Woman that Durlons can turn into anything. Wonder Woman then has an idea and wraps her lasso around the fuselage and soon, an ammo box in the back of the plane starts forming out of shape and Captain Atom stuns the Durlon so that Wonder Woman can question him with her lasso.</p><p>Back in Boston, Hermes uses his powers and all the buildings that fell are building themselves again, as if someone was rewinding on a tape. A stranger in the alley however, is still skeptical of his work. The stranger then leaps up and punches Hermes. Now revealed, he is known as the Creeper. He tells Hermes that this place isn’t big enough for them and punches him furiously. Hermes then brings himself to composure but the Creeper kicks him and the TV crews are still broadcasting this. At the Kapatelis home, Julia is glad as she tells Vanessa that he probably needs this.</p><p>At the Atlantic, Captain Atom and Wonder Woman approach the prison that the Durlon had told them and she tells Captain Atom that they need to sneak or else they might kill Steve if the Durlons see them. Captain Atom agrees, saying he will never forgive himself if his good friend is hurt. He continues, saying his name is Cameron Scott and regrets not telling his friend that Captain Atom and Cameron Scott is the same person. Soon, they come across a cave entrance with a tree next to it, just like the interrogated Durlon said. Captain Atom the blasts the tree which proves to be a Durlon. They make their way inside as there is a split and they agree to split up. Wonder Woman sneaks through, looking for any sign of movement that may be Steve. She approaches a door and feels that that is the right room, but Captain Atom calls her from behind. He tells her he found Steve, but she turns back to the door as she feels something is behind it. Wonder Woman feels a bit suspicious… she asks if Cameron Scott is with Steve and he replies ""Eh? Why yes he's with Trevor.” Her suspicious are confirmed and she confronts him and tells him that he is <i>not</i> Captain Atom. He throws a couple hard punches but is frustrated with her ability as she <i>doesn’t</i> fall. He grabs her neck and informs him that Amazons do not fall so easily and slams him into a wall. With that one finished, she wonders if there is another Durlon impersonating <i>her</i>. Elsewhere in the base, Captain Atom himself is confronted by a fake Wonder Woman and he too has realised it is a Durlon in disguise. He punches him sending him through a wall and the Durlon grabs a weapon, but Captain Atom tells him that it is useless. A few seconds later, the Durlon is out cold and sees Steve held up in this torture contraption. He approaches him but then is lassoed by Wonder Woman. She tells him that she just needed to find out whether he was the real Captain Atom. Steve tells them that he is okay, but he is very concerned about Etta but Wonder Woman tells him that he needs to see a doctor first.</p><p>In Boston, the city has returned to its normal state while the fight between Creeper and Hermes continue. With the commentary from the TV crew, Creeper is hitting hard but Hermes seems to be unfazed. Finally, Hermes grabs Creeper’s foot and throws him to the ground and unleashes a blast of energy towards him. He thinks Harmonia is right, but there must be a way to make atonement. Creeper then gets up and is ready to charge Hermes but he finds himself held back by Wonder Woman’s lasso. She touches the ground with Steve. Hermes thanks her for he didn’t want to destroy Creeper. She asks him what he has been doing and he replies that he has been returning the city to its normal state. Perhaps he is too impatient and that the mortals need time. On Olympus, time didn’t really matter, but on Man’s World, time sure goes by slowly!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""<em>The Immortal Storm</em>"" written by George Perez, plot assists by Keith Giffen and Cary Bates, penciled by Chris Marrinan, inked by Will Blyberg, lettered by Augustyn Mas and Helen Vesik and colored by Carl Gafford.</li><li>""<em>Of Wings and Arrows</em>"" ""<em>Legends of the Amazons</em>"" ""<em>Bonus Book!

For the first time, they allow mortals to walk on their land and Steve Trevor along with Etta Candy, Diana and Hippolyta are taking a stroll through their land. Diana translates for Steve and Hippolyta as he wishes to thank her for that they have done. Hippolyta replies that the healers were happy to help as they had never seen such injuries on the person. Steve then remarks how beautiful this island is and how he was to bomb it. Diana replies that it is truly okay and he has no need to pay a debt. Philippus joins in saying that she became angry because Diana had put Steve on the healing table and would have never considered him being Diana Trevor’s son but he clearly has Diana’s bravery running through him and for Philippus salutes him. Hippolyta adds that what they say are true from the heart because if it wasn’t for Steve and Etta, the Amazons survive once again and both of them embrace. Etta also gives her thanks, saying that this visit means so much to her. At first she was nervous at meeting Hippolyta, but she knew that Hippolyta would be the loving, rational and noble queen that Diana had described.</p><p>Philippus suggests that they go visit the Temple of Hades and Hippolyta agrees as she asks Steve if he would like to see his mother’s statue. The group make their way but Diana mounts her horse as she needs to talk with some people first and meet with Hellene, Iphthime and Oenone. Diana asks their opinions on Steve, and Hellene replies that they are impressed with Steve. However, even though they have an open mind, this is not easy on them at all. Diana replies that she doesn’t understand and Oenone says there is a great irony here. Diana is confused and Iphthime replies how the first two men to set foot on Paradise Island planned on destroying it and that they have also changed. With time, the Amazons forgave, but she reminds Diana that just because they apologise doesn’t mean they can start anew again.</p><p>In Boston, Barry Locatelli and Lucy Spears and they are having a talk. Barry reassures Lucy that Vanessa meant nothing to him and Lucy had also heard some stories, but she wasn’t sure who to believe. Barry explains that Vanessa had misunderstood him and Lucy asks him to explain what he meant when he said that his cousin wanted Wonder Woman’s autograph. He replies that Vanessa was very close to Wonder Woman and he asked if Vanessa could arrange it for him and reassures her once again that Lucy is the right person for him. Lucy apologises for doubting him and can understand why Vanessa would fret over him and maybe they should find a more private spot. She suggests the boys’ locker room as it’s empty and Barry leads her there. He pokes his head in to see if the coast is clear and as he steps inside, a bucket of paint falls over him and he sees Vanessa and his friends outside laughing at him. It turns out Lucy was in it all along and throws him a jacket, telling the “macho creep” to clean himself up. Vanessa then follows through with a kick to his shins and they all run outside leaving a humiliated Barry.</p><p>Meanwhile in California an army convoy is making their way through a desolated road but suddenly, many trees fall in their path. From the trees come gas grenades smoking the whole place up. Armed men from the trees show themselves and from the back of van they attempt to open it and find one officer who has not been knocked unconscious by the gas lifts up a gun but is shot down by a machine gun. Then, they turn their attention to the back of a truck and blow away the lock and inside, it looks like there are two high-tech coffins.</p><p>Back on the Themyscira, Steve and Etta stand before Diana Trevor’s statue. Etta tells Steve that she was a great mother and his father used to say Steve inherited his stubbornness and impatience and it took him a while to realise his father was paying him a compliment. He tries to hold back his tears and addresses the statue as he says ""I just wanted to tell you...I understand now why you had to leave us that Christmas Eve. Why you had to pursue your dreams. Why you had to fly"" and summarises his life. He has a happy job, happy life with great friends and adds that he will always love her. Outside, the Amazons wait for them and Steve compliments them on such a magnificent monument. Diana asks if they would like more time on Paradise Island, but Steve and Etta say that they have much to do but first there is something that he must say. He does the Amazonian salute and says “thank you” in Themyscirian and Hippolyta replies in English that the doors to Themyscira will always be open to him.</p><p>Afternoon in Boston, Julia is driving Vanessa home from school and Vanessa tells her mother about the prank they played on. Her mother does not approve of this payback but she adds that Barry must have looked embarrassed! They pull up to the house but see a truck with men taking furniture out of the truck. Julia and Vanessa enter the house and see Hermes floating in the air and he hopes that this is to their liking and they realise that they had all their furniture replaced just like it was before Decay had destroyed them. Julia asks why he has done this and he replies that this is peace offering. He also eased the work on the moving men and they were quite grateful. He hopes that Julia is just as grateful as they are.</p><p>Back in California, the high-tech coffins are being boarded on a plane and there, Chuma greets them. They are then handed a case of money from Chuma and he tells them to not bother counting the money as they would not be stupid enough to cheat mercenaries and the mercenaries reply that if they do, they will suffer the same fate as the gunned down officer. Chuma shudders as he replies that there were meant to be no casualties. Chuma is about to strike the lead mercenary but his mistress tells him to let go. He turns to Barbara Minerva and tells her about the officer that was gunned down, and that they should pay. She replies that there is no need to worry. They <em>will</em> pay soon enough. She then orders the pilot to open the coffins and inside is two Khunds in which Wonder Woman had captured. She then stands over the two aliens and starts waving a stick in front of them, telling them that she is offering a chance for them to avenge themselves against whoever killed them. She will help them, but only if they will obey her.</p><p>Back in Boston, Vanessa is overjoyed that her furniture is back in place and Julia looks puzzled. Hermes asks her if she is not pleased with this and she replies that she <em>is</em> pleased with this. It’s just that their last encounter wasn’t so nice. He apologises and says that even Gods have boundaries and assures her that he is not trying to buy his way out of it and he says that he may be a little extravagant in his buying as Vanessa upstairs yelps for joy as he she discovers her room has a surround sound system. Hermes says that if Julia does not approve he would be happy to remove it, but she replies that her daughter would never forgive her if she took if away! She then thanks Hermes and says that it is a very nice gesture but Julia notes how everything is exactly the same. He responds that he is a messenger, and that he is the god of communication and that he is excellent in reading people.</p><p>Later that night, the two Khunds are waiting in Martha’s Vineyard and are becoming impatient as they have been waiting for a while now. Both of them despise the arrogant Barbara Minerva, but she too hates Wonder Woman and they have a common goal. Once they have finished Wonder Woman, they will finish Minerva. Suddenly, there is a disturbance in the sky as a portal opens in the sky with Wonder Woman carrying Steve and Etta. The Khunds then aim their weapons and open fire but luckily, her reflexes save her and her two friends from being killed. She swoops down the trees and drops her friends off and Steve tells her that he recognises those weapons and Diana agrees saying that they are weapons of the Khunds. She tells them to get to safety. Meanwhile, the Khunds looks for their target as they tell each other that they haven’t seen someone react so fast to their fire. They then see a tree fall upon them and dive as the tree falls to the ground. The first Khund gets to his feet but is punched by Wonder Woman. He then raises his weapon to fire at her but again, she deflects with her bracelets. She then realises that the second Khund is no where to be found. He is has disappeared. Steve and Etta try and escape when suddenly the Khund pounces on them but the both of them evade his attack from their military training. With his momentum, they throw the Khund over their shoulder but manages to get Steve. Elsewhere, Wonder Woman is about to use her lasso on her Khund when he fires upon her but she protects herself just in time and she realises that she needs to end this quickly. She kicks the Khund and secures him as she sees another Khund behind her with Steve and Etta struggling to escape. He hurls them over the ridge and flies to grab her friends and taking them back to a safe spot. She returns to where the Khunds were to see that they have escaped. The two Khunds are put aboard on a plane. One of them is still tied up by and Chuma uses this as an advantage and asks what he intends to do once he is freed. The Khund replies that he will kill Minerva and the other Khund leaps up at Chuma but he hears a growl behind him.</p><p>Outside, Wonder Woman spots the helicopter and chases it. As she approaches it, she finds a missile ejected from it and without her lasso, she cannot tie it up, and prepares to use her bracelets. As the missiles draw closer, she realises that there are two Khunds with devices strapped to their chests and realise that they are to detonate before they hit her. She falls to the ground and Steve and Etta race to her and the Amazon tries to clear her head. She remembers that as the Khunds were making their way to her, they had been mauled, as if attacked by a savage animal… she then realises that who ever had escaped in the helicopter now has her lasso!</p>",,,,,,,False,30871,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/27827-3824-30871-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url':

It beats like the rhythmic drum. Somewhere outside the castle, the mercenary leader and his colleague who had gunned down an officer during the raid wait. They are to meet with Barbara Minerva but the soldier feels uneasy. Why has she asked them to meet here when her castle is just over the hills? His commander replies that she is paying them and that she is the leader, so they follow her. The soldier still isn’t convinced after Chuma said he was displeased about the casualty (that happened in issue #27). Just then, they hear a sound, but nothing is there. The sound comes from the opposite direction but still, they see nothing. They split up and think it is the sound of an animal. The soldier then hears his commander scream and he turns around. The drumbeat is getting faster. He rushes over to the van and finds his commander on the floor and sees that the tires have also been slashed. He opens fire into the undergrowth surrounding him. As he fires, he hears a yelp. The soldier checks his shot but it is only a dog, but there is no blood on his teeth which means the dog couldn’t have killed the commander. He then hears a growl behind him and it’s too late as the Cheetah pounces. Inside the castle, Chuma hears the scream and the drumbeat slows down.</p><p>Elsewhere, in the Chaos void between Man’s World and Paradise Island Wonder Woman and Hermes are calling for Hestia’s help and the princess prays that she needs her help, desperately. As the power surges through the Caduceus, Hermes’ staff, Wonder Woman says this is useless as Hestia cannot hear them. He tells her to concentrate as this is important and she replies that maybe Hestia chooses not to reply. Is losing the lasso forgivable? He replies that it is not her fault and he shall see the recovery of the lasso is done. Even though Diana sees it as Hestia’s lasso, the gods see it as <em>her</em> lasso, and she is responsible for it. She then asks Hermes to take her back to Man’s World and he asks how she intends to find her lasso without the help of the gods. She replies that she already has.</p><p>In the Boston Police Department Inspector Ed Indelicato and Lt. Shands are speaking with Julia Kapatelis, Christine Fenton, Etta Candy and Steve Trevor about the theft of Wonder Woman’s lasso. Shands holds a magazine called Archaeological Digest"". On the cover is Barbara Minerva. Christine also tells him that Myndi Mayer had set up a meeting with Minerva because she had an artifact that was supposedly connected to the Amazons, but the artifact was a fake and it was only a plan to steal Wonder Woman’s lasso. Christine wants her questioned and she asks why they haven’t as they have her address. Shands replies that there is not enough hard evidence. Julia says that she knows Minerva and she is very infamous due to her unethical methods. She is known to go through long lengths to retrieve any artifact and she has done with the Lasso of Truth. She then turns to Ed and tells him that he surely Diana is not the type to work on hunches. Shand butts in and says that Julia is just trying to convince him and that Minerva freed some alien prisoners of war and had them attack Wonder Woman and also had them killed. He says that this is surely a military issue. Etta says that the Pentagon is investigating but the mercenaries did not leave any traces. Even with the attack on Steve and Etta, they still have no connection with Minerva and these attacks. Steve adds that he has not found that helicopter, but he is not giving up just yet. Julia tells them that even as farfetched as this sounds, Minerva is capable of doing this as she is not mentally stable, especially after the African expedition. Just then, the Police Chief bursts in and tells them that there are a couple people outside waiting for them. Outside is Wonder Woman and Hermes and they have had no luck in finding the lasso and that they have had no luck in finding Hestia. Julia suggests that it is about time they left and Wonder Woman asks about Minerva and is handed the magazine with Minerva on the cover. Julia firmly believes that Minerva is the culprit but they have no proof and she has tried calling her in England. Wonder Woman stares at the cover and decides on her next move.</p><p>A few days later, the English papers’ headlines are filled with Wonder Woman’s arrival in England. This reaches Chuma and he wonders if this is merely a coincidence to why Wonder Woman has come. There is no connection to Minerva’s attack but Wonder Woman is no fool. Chuma feels he has a sacred duty and must protect his master.</p><p>In Boston, in the Kapatelis house, Julia, Vanessa, Hermes and Steve read the headlines on Wonder Woman. Julia explains how Diana wanted to personally meet Minerva and she is has made it look like a side trip as apart of an Ambassadorial visit. Hermes says that she should have let him take care of this. Julia tells him that she is not comfortable with Diana going by herself, but they all know how tenacious she can get and that she can be responsible and acts on her beliefs. She believes that to be the right and duty of all living things and that is what Julia respects her for. Hermes doesn’t understand the term “modern woman” and Julia replies that she doesn’t think that women are changing, it’s just that society is catching up to them. Hermes is still unconvinced and Steve says he can’t explain modern women. He just has to experience them. Vanessa adds her own input to why they are so worried about her and Minerva. Minerva is just a cripple and surely Diana will beat her easily!</p><p>In England, Diana gets out of a taxi. The taxi begins to drive away and she thinks to herself that she could not let the taxi go any closer to the castle as she feels that the castle is dangerous. She can smell the blood and she can feel that something horrible has happened. Meanwhile, she is watched by Chuma from a pair of binoculars. Diana arrives at the castle and is sitting inside a room and Chuma asks if she would like some tea. She declines as she has some bad reaction to caffeine but he replies that it is just herbal tea. He takes a sip from his own cup and asks what her business with Minerva is today. She replies that it is a private business matter. She then takes a sip from her tea and she falls to the floor and begins shivering madly. Her tea has been spiked and her limbs are starting to paralyze. Chuma then stands over her, adding that he cannot let her harm his master. Diana then realises that Cheetah and Barbara Minerva is the same person and she asks how such a cripple can turn into a virile animal. Chuma tells Diana that his master ordered him for the drug to be long lasting and slow, so that he can tell the story of Cheetah! It started with an African expedition. Her and her colleague, Dr. Tom Leavens were on an expedition to the Temple of Urzkartaga. After two months, they found nothing but Barbara was determined to find something. Barbara had bribed a local priest to act as her guide and he pointed out a necklace and the priest knew that the city was close but he warned how it was very dangerous as the Cat God lived there. Barbara didn’t believe the priest however and after a few minutes of trekking, the priest ordered them to stop. There was no city, but suddenly, war cries were yelled out and soon they were surrounded by warriors. One of the men opened fire in fear and he was struck down by a spear and the party defended itself. Despite the odds, Barbara did not show fear, only hate. She threw a smoke grenade and she and Tom had made it out. They made their way to a cliff with a river down below. They had no choice and both of them jumped down with spears and arrows following close by. Barbara was a strong swimmer. That’s how she escaped when Julia shot her when Cheetah attacked Diana. The two professors made it and Barbara was pumped and was so excited that they were near the city. Tom could not believe how she reacted, even though her colleagues were dead. She told him that she would find the treasure or he could make it back to safety alone. Later that night, Tom and Barbara were observing a tribe and a ceremony was taking place. In front of the tribe was the Temple of Urzkartaga. They could also see the priest who had betrayed them and saw him sacrifice one of the colleagues. Tom wanted to go, but Barbara insisted that they stay.</p><p>Meanwhile, the priest had revealed a female with the markings of the Cheetah. She was dying and now was the time for her to be renewed. The priest held up a little jar of fresh blood and the Cheetah drank the blood. But a gun shot was fired and hit the jar, and went through to her chest. An armed force attacked the tribe and Barbara was watching, wondering how they found the temple. She then recognised two of the armed men from her own expedition team and she then realised that they followed her. The priest grabbed the Cheetah and as his cloak fell, it was clear that the priest was Chuma. One of the armed men then threw a grenade, but she jumped out of the way and had pushed Chuma into the temple. The explosion caused the entrance to collapse.</p><p>Chuma realises that Diana is not moving at her and the drugs must be almost finished doing their job. He tells how Barbara only wanted treasure and after the collapse of the entrance, there was silence. His eyes were accustomed to the darkness and there he could see Barbara was a gun pointed at him, and she was not happy.</p>",,,,,,,False,30982,"{'icon_url':

They climb on board to investigate and discover that it is the Libyan ship they have been pursuing before. There are signs of struggle and some of the booty has been looted. One of the officers investigate some more and step inside to find bodies that look like it has been torn apart by an animal.</p><p>In England, in Barbara Minerva’s castle, Chuma continues his story about Minerva becoming the Cheetah. He tells how the Temple of Urzkartaga had been ruined due to expeditions and a gun pointing at him would surely mean his death. Barbara questioned Chuma, asking him why she should not shoot him in the head and he replies that he has nothing to live for, seeing as his god is dead now. He pleads to her to shoot him dead and he doesn’t understand why she didn’t do so. He thinks back and realises Barbara’s face had broken into a sly smile, which meant that Urzkartaga had given him another chance. Barbara had asked him about the ritual he was performing. Who was the cat-woman standing by his feet and what’s the history of the ceremony. She also comments on the woman being human. She <em>was</em> human, and she was the god that protected the <em>great</em> God. She was the Cheetah! Barbara was skeptical as she questioned the whole god thing, and Chuma asked her that with all her expeditions, she had surely encountered something that was beyond scientific explanation.</p><p>Barbara was suspicious. She had heard of this Cat God, but why had she not defended her tribe against attackers. And if the tribe wanted to be isolated, why did Chuma lead her to the tribe? Chuma replied that it was only an act of desperation, and that they needed new blood. Many years ago, the tribe had led the drunk into the tribe for new blood and soon after, other tribes had learned of Boatengan's raids and hired armed assassins. Many cultists were captured but none of them betrayed their god – except one. The traitor was also captured, but he escaped and made it back to camp. The Cheetah had killed him for his ways. Two of the assassins escaped and returned with a party and killed all the tribesmen and Cheetah. The Boatengan had learned of the death of the traitor and in this time, Cheetah had never killed one of her own followers. The priests had been saying that he was a traitor and the other cultists took it as a bad sign and began killing the priests, feeding their blood to Cheetah. Chuma tried to warn them that doing so was a corrupt sacrifice, but they did not listen and under these rituals, Cheetah was becoming weaker. Chuma was then the only priest left and the followers had seen what they had done. Chuma prayed for something good to happen and he learned of Barbara’s expedition and saw it as a chance to get Cheetah strong again.</p><p>Barbara was interested and Cheetah had been kept alive but soon she would be nothing. Chuma begged for her to end his life but she felt it would not suit her needs and she wanted to know how the ritual would’ve gone if they did not interrupt him. Chuma showed Barbara what would’ve happened and showed her a plant on an altar. A mix from the vine and blood would keep Cheetah immortal. She then demanded that he make her mortal, and Chuma replied that he could do no such thing. He would need fresh blood and she requested if the blood could come from her own body. Soon, Tom Leavens, who was a colleague and was calling out for her and she instructed him to get some explosives and blast this entrance clear. He soon blasted out the rubble but the sound had alerted the raiders and they turned back to the entrance while Leavens was helping Barbara and Chuma out. Barbara realised they did not have a lot of time, and stabbed Tom in the back, killing him. With fresh blood, she asked Chuma to perform the ritual but Chuma replied that she would need to drink the blood! And with that, she opened his wound up and drank the blood. Chuma then began the ritual and Barbara lay naked on the altar and cut he wrist, draining her blood and offered it to the plant. The plant then accepted. Chuma then dressed her in a cheetah costume and put markings of a cheetah on her face. Outside, the tribesmen were getting closer and plucked a leaf from the plant and mixed it with some herbs. Barbara then drank the liquefied mix, and the tribesmen were outside. The tribesmen outside were studying the dead body and they hear a growl coming from a tree and find Cheetah. The men were shocked, but Cheetah took no time and tore them apart. They set fire to the village and had taken the plant along with her to England. But there was one thing that Chuma was not prepared for, and it was the “side effects”. The original ceremony had to be a virgin, and Barbara was not and the Plant God was very jealous. With that, Barbara’s body began to deteriorate and if she was the Cheetah, only then was she strong. The potion which made her strong was beginning to run out and hunting down new bodies was Cheetah’s aim. Until she found the Lasso of Truth, of course. When Barbara got hold of the lasso, something strange happened to her, and even Chuma was stumped. Standing over Wonder Woman, he tells her when Barbara heard she was coming, she ordered him to tell Wonder Woman the Cheetah’s origin and now that he has finished, he must tend to his plant. Wonder Woman asks if he is going to the plant. He then realises that Wonder Woman’s speech is long slurred and that she had been tricking him all this time. Suddenly, she leaps to her feet and tackles him and is confused as to why the poison did not kill her. She tells him that ever since they were drugged many centuries ago by Hercules, they had found ways to evade that with herbology. All they had to do was smell the herb and identify it. Wonder Woman then asks where Barbara is and she spots a plane ticket and reading it, says she is going to Egypt.</p><p>Meanwhile in Libya, a tracking station spots a fast moving object and assume it is some kind of jet, but is suddenly disappears! Wonder Woman, now in her costume, arrives in Egypt and she feels that her lasso is close by. Suddenly a sandstorm storms up and she can hear wailing – she is definitely on the right track and can feel it in the whirlwind. She dives inside and finds herself fighting against strong winds and jagged rocks. Her eyes are irritated from the sand but she has to get through. She <em>must</em>. She bursts through and plunges below, into an ancient city. She falls through a glass ceiling and walks through a corridor and sees two dead women in armour. It must have been Cheetah’s work and she sees the bracelets they are wearing and what they are wearing seem very familiar. She then finds herself surrounded by more armoured women holding guns and they yell something in their language… Diana recognises it… it’s Themyscrian! She realises that they too are Amazons and they are about to kill her.</p>",,,,,,,False,31079,"{'icon_url':

Indelicato, prompting Shands to read it, reads it. Tamsyn McConnell picked up Barbara Minerva from the airport the day before Minerva tried to steal Wonder Woman’s lasso and then was killed when Minerva met up with Wonder Woman. The next day, Wonder Woman had also encountered a large cat. Many murders are connected to this cat, such as the mercenaries hired to free the Khunds hired by Minerva. It all adds up in Shands’ head as he connects the murder of the Khunds as they too were murdered and the English archaeologist who visited the West Coast at the same time.</p><p>In Syene Kesh, the quiet is interrupted by the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall where they run to the hotel and run up to Barbara Minerva’s room. Chuma runs outside into the hallway to find more Amazons and throws a gas grenade, killing all those who have sucked in the toxic gas. He then tells Minerva that she must do what he says, or else she will die. He hands her the dagger and instructs her to perform the ritual on the sedated Amazons. Queen Anahid is informed of the losses due to Chuma and orders one of the Amazons Gisa to burn down the whole village. She brings some Amazons with her but her chariot is upturned as two spears change her course of path. She looks up and finds Wonder Woman. They retaliate by firing on her with their own guns but she is too quick and dodges them. She fires arrows on them knocking their weapons out of their hands and they try to reach for their fallen weapons but fail as she runs through them knocking them out.</p><p>A Bana-Mighdall Amazon is climbing the wall to Minerva’s window but falls to her death as a growl in heard. Wonder Woman turns to find the source of the growl and sees Cheetah. Wonder Woman tries to make her way towards Cheetah but is blocked by more Amazons. Meanwhile, Queen Anahid is the only one standing in front of Cheetah. Cheetah manages to knock Anahid against a wall but she retaliates with the cobra spit. Anahid is surprised that she also survives the toxic. Cheetah lets out a growl but then slashes Anahid’s stomach open. Cheetah is about to finish Anahid when a punch sends her flying and sees Wonder Woman.</p><p>Even though Wonder Woman is a pacifist, she too has a breaking point and she tells Cheetah to stop this or else she will have to kill her. Wonder Woman and Cheetah are fighting when Gisa shows up and sees a chance to destroy the both of them at the same time. However, Anahid forbids it as Wonder Woman had saved her and this is a fight between Cheetah and Wonder Woman.</p><p>The both of them are fighting when Wonder Woman remembers Chuma. From the top of the building from a window, he fires a dart and it hits her thigh. She manages to survive, but the toxins are affecting her. This allows Cheetah to strike Wonder Woman, with left and right scratches. The Amazons of Bana-Mighdall fire upon Chuma and he falls to the ground. It is an unfair unadvantage for Wonder Woman, and they tell her that they will hold off Cheetah until Wonder Woman extracts the poisons from her body. She moves away from the battle, and uses her tiara to cut open the wound and sucks the poisons into her mouth and then spits them out. While the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall are fighting off Cheetah, Wonder Woman feels more revitalised than ever and throws a rock towards Cheetah, catching her attention. The building near them then starts to rumble from their fight and Cheetah attempts to strangle Wonder Woman but she tears off Cheetah’s tail and she howls in agony. With the tail in her hand she uses it as a whip, sending Cheetah into a wall. With Cheetah down, she punches Cheetah multiple times, each punch getting harder and harder. Wonder Woman looks down on Cheetah. More Amazon warriors come with their weapons ready but Gisa orders them to holster their weapons. Queen Anahid had died from the wounds, but Wonder Woman has avenged her and ordered Wonder Woman to be spared.</p><p>Wonder Woman is tending to Chuma’s wounds, but they too are too difficult to mend. He thanks her for not killing Cheetah and asks her if she can get the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall to spare Cheetah as she is the most important to him, in addition to the Plant God. She replies that they will not kill Cheetah if she returns the artifacts. He tells them that they are in a rubbish bin on the other side of the hotel. He slips away and he tells Wonder Woman to tell his mistress that he will always be his servant. She covers him with a cloth and tells the Amazons to follow her and make their way to the other side of the hotel. She searches under some rubble and finds her lasso lying beneath the rubble. Nehebka asks why such a rope is so important, and Wonder Woman proves a point as the lasso points towards the artifact. Nehebka searches under the pieces of rubble and finds their own artifact. Wonder Woman watches Nehebka hold up the prized artifact just like her mother did… and realises that the artifact is the <em>other</em> Golden Girdle of Gaea!</p>",,,,,,,False,31306,"{'icon_url':

Hippolyta reminisces about Wonder Woman's very first hunt.</em></p><p>On Themyscira, a hunting party of Amazons set out on foot called the “Hunt of Honour”. Penelope is disappointed that Diana couldn’t join them, but Hippolyta replies that she has things to do on Man’s World, but she will return regardless. Hippolyta and the party make their way up a hill called Decian Hill where the statue of Artemis is standing. It is then Hippolyta remembers Diana’s first hunt. Diana had hunted for a stag and found one, and that is when Hippolyta ordered her to fire into its heart. Diana’s arrow fell short, but Hippolyta knew that she did that on purpose, as she was the best marksman there was. Hippolyta then ordered her daughter to go after the runaway animal, and Diana ran into the woods. It was then that Hippolyta heard cries of agony from an animal. She saw that the stag had been injured by a wild boar. Diana could bear it no more and ran after the boar and tackled it to the ground. Diana then prepared for the kill, but her mother stopped her explaining to her that Artemis’ choice for sacrifice was not by chance but by choice. Just then, an Amazon alerts everyone to a boar and she asks Menalippe if she is ready to kill. Menalippe aims and lets go of the arrow, heading for the target.</p><p>Back at Man’s World in Boston, Julia Kapatelis is finishing off a class when Mr. Vicks walks in and hands her a letter. He tells her that her research bond has been granted, but Julia isn’t too enthusiastic. Mr. Vicks asks her what the problem is and she replies that Wonder Woman hasn’t called in for days from England. Mr. Vicks reassures her saying that from what he has read, Wonder Woman is capable of taking care of herself. He also tells her that a couple police officers are in her office. Julia steps into her office and Inspector Ed Indelicato and Lt. Mike Shands are inside. Julia asks if they have learned anything and Indelicato replies that they have… but she won’t like it! Julia talks about a cat woman, but the officers aren’t too clear on what she is talking about so she recounts the night she shot Cheetah into the lake just before she was going to kill Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman never found the body and then Ed hands her a photo of Barbara Minerva. Then suddenly, Julia realises in horror that Barbara Minerva and Cheetah is the same person.</p><p>In Massachusetts Steve Trevor is waiting for Etta Candy as he has some very important news to tell her. Etta Candy comes, all angry, and Steve hopes that he didn’t make her angry. She replies that it is not him, and asks him what the important news is. Steve says it can wait and asks her why she is so angry, and so she begins to recount her day. General Hillary had been transferred to Washington, and the man taking his place was George Yedziniak. However, Etta and Yedziniak went a long way back, as Steve Trevor had tried to ruin the reputation of three commanders. Since Etta was in a relationship with Steve then and did not get involved with the fiasco, Yedziniak refused to transfer her as he accused her of being a security threat. Steve tells her that it will be alright and Etta replies that nothing will stop her from loving him. She kisses him goodbye and Steve realises that this is <em>not</em> the best time to tell Etta what happened this evening.</p><p>It all began when Hermes visited him this morning. Hermes asked Steve that he needed to experience being a mortal but Steve replies that he is quite busy, working at the Air Force. Hermes explains that he does not need to work for any mortal again, but Steve replies that that is what being apart of a mortal was all about. Hermes also wished to learn about the modern woman. So with that, Hermes raised his Caduceus and changed his clothes from his robe to casual clothing and asks Steve what they should do first.</p><p>In New Hampshire, Hermes, still wearing his casual clothing is in front of his temple in which he erected when he was a god amongst the mortals, when Ixion had attacked. He snaps his finger and his Caduceus appears and destroys the temple, yet he feels pain. This is not possible as he is a god!</p><p>At the same moment, the Amazons have finished their hunt and they are hopeful that Diana will join them in the Feast of Five. Menalippe replies that she too is looking forward to it and then all of a sudden, she is struck by a thunder bolt and cries out a name at the same time as Hermes, “Gaea!”</p><p>Back at the Kapatelis house, Julia is greeted by her daughter, Vanessa, but Julia is tired and doesn’t want to be disturbed. Vanessa replies that Diana is on the phone. Julia’s face lights up and she makes her way to the phone, telling Diana that she is glad she has called and continues to explain that she has found out something about Barbara Minerva. Julia hesitates and then demands to know who is on the other side of the line, as it is definitely not Diana. The stranger then hangs up. Vanessa asks her what is wrong. Julia explains that even though it sounded like Diana, she had pronounced one word that Diana has said a thousand times over: “Gaea!”</p><p>Meanwhile, in Syene Kesh, the Bana-Mighdall Amazons hangs up and another two Amazons stand over the slain body of the shopkeeper. The first Amazon takes a look at the picture of Diana and Julia standing together and rips it, letting the picture flutter to the ground. The Amazons then walk out, riding their horses out into the desert.</p>",,,,,,,False,31413,"{'icon_url':

They are surrounded by an angry mob of toga wearers who tell them they are trespassing. Terry asks for Katin Leikos. Someone recognises Donna as Troia and yells that she is the saviour’s sister. Katina then steps forward and tells them to leave as they don’t have time for “disbelievers”. Donna replies that she just wants to ask some questions and mentions Dr. Stavros Christadoulodou.

Donna leaves and makes her way to the boat. Terry is surprised that she would just give up so easily, and Donna replies that she understands his frustration as she thought she had it all figured out. Most of her dreams had been like tiny puzzle pieces, and now they were coming together. She mentions the burning eyes in her dreams. It had all come together last night. In her dream, she had been leading the Teen Titans, when she saw those eyes and felt a sense of recognition about those eyes. It was a Scourge Demon, and her team mates were telling her to get away, but she was frozen, looking at those eyes. She moved a second too late and it dug into her flesh, and then everything had gone black. Then she could see Raven and she was using her empathetic powers to absorb Donna’s pain. But then she looked into Raven’s eyes and she could see something was wrong. She was darkening like a black hole and there was a gate to another world. Donna then fell through the black hole and fell into a world where there were many creatures with red eyes just like in the sewers. One of them attacked her but she fought back. She remembered seeing a Greek woman and a young girl who was crying out the name, “Diana,” and then it went black again.</p><p>Back in New York, Wonder Woman wonders about the rag in her hand and what connection it has to her right now, in her dream. Her dreams have been more like nightmares, while she had been fighting against Circe’s werebeasts, as she could not let them get to Vanessa. She fights the beasts when Circe struck her down with lightning. She hears Vanessa call out, “Diana!” She awoke in her dream and it had been illuminated where she could see the beasts around her again. An unknown voice then calls out “Donna!” Her dream then turned in oblivion, but thankfully she had woken up. A mysterious voice had led her down to these sewers. She can feel the pain inflicted from the beasts even though she has no wounds. She then hears a sound and drops her rag and undoes her lasso. She asks them to come forward and from the darkness comes a pair of red eyes.</p><p>Back with Donna, her, Terry and Stavros finally get to meet up in a café. Stavros apologises for Katina’s manners, as she had become ever more obsessed with Wonder Woman ever since she had destroyed Circe and smashed statues of her as she disowned the cult. Donna wonders if there are any ways to get some answers. She could talk with Diana, if only their schedules weren’t so conflicting. She had left a message at Julia Kapatelis’ house hoping to meet her in Greece, though she didn’t know about the death of Vanessa’s friend, Lucy Spears. Terry adds that they had found out about the U.N. summit next month. They had to go to Diana as Donna’s dreams were driving her crazy. Stavros wishes that Gregori Davalos was still around, as he would be able to help with the Katina situation, but nobody knows where he is. Stavros asks if Donna would like to come along to look at the Themysciran goblet they recently found, but Donna declines. A black cat, not too far away from them, runs off after watching them.</p><p>In Boston, at Vanessa’s school, Julia speaks with the school counselor, Helen Anderson. She informs Julia of Vanessa’s psychologist’s observations. She then asks about Vanessa and her relationship with Wonder Woman. Julia asks what this has to do with Wonder Woman. Helen replies that Vanessa has gone through her father’s death, the pressures of school, her traveling mother, and the death of her best friend… and Wonder Woman, who puts Vanessa in danger all the time. Wonder Woman has put Vanessa in danger and Helena suggests that Vanessa cut all ties with Wonder Woman. If she doesn’t, Vanessa may never be able to face the pressures of the real world. Julia is upset by this; Vanessa doesn’t need to be handled carefully because she’s not luggage. She adds that Vanessa loves Diana and asks how she will react once Diana leaves as a loved one? Helen replies that Vanessa will fear that she may never come back. Julia, shaken by this, walks outside and leans herself against the wall. There has to be some other way…</p><p>In the sewers, Wonder Woman is attacked by another werebeast and she uses her lasso to stop it from moving. Though as she does so, she notices other beasts as well, wearing trinkets made out of human bones. They attack her and raises her bracelets in defence. The mysterious voice that led her here tells her what good her compassion is if she’s fighting against beasts that kill without thought. She has to kill them, unless she wants them to kill her first. The voice coaxes her to bring out her savage side. The voice reminds her of her time with Cheetah, and the anger she showed that time. She is a beast herself! The werebeasts then retreat including the cat that had been watching Donna. Wonder Woman wonders why they had retreated. She then sees a light coming from behind her and sees the beast she wrapped in her lasso go up in flames, thanks to the lasso! Wonder Woman is confused wondering why she has been brought here. She remembers the day she left Themyscira and the face of her worried mother. Maybe her mother could see just how disturbing her dreams are and how much in common Diana had with Donna Troy. They needed to meet with each other. Were they fated to never meet up again? Wonder Woman remembers the self-pity she felt upon her arrival to Man’s World, and how it disappeared ever since she stopped hearing those voices. She followed it and came to the sewers. She flies out of the sewers through a drain and realises that this is the voice of Circe!</p><p>Elsewhere, the cat from the sewers transforms into a woman. A man calls out to her, her name being Anna, and Anna says tells Theophilos Ventouras that Bestiamorphs still run around in the sewers and that they had attacked Wonder Woman. He asks if Diana is still down there and she replies that she doesn’t know as she had fled before the beasts had seen her. She adds that perhaps this is a sign that Wonder Woman can help them. Theo disagrees, he says that they cannot rely on her for this. Anna asks if he is wrong, and Theo says that he isn’t. Not after all these years. They will succeed and be free at last…</p><p>Wonder Woman makes her way back to Boston to the Kapatelis residence and is greeted by Vanessa. Julia tells her about Donna’s message, and about Donna traveling to Cephalonia. Vanessa yells back at Diana, in an annoyed tone. Diana explains that she has to meet with Donna as she hasn’t been able to do so for a while now. Vanessa runs upstairs in a huff and yells back, “Fine! Go away then! Get yourself killed! Get out of here! I never want to see you again! You can go to hell for all I care!” Diana apologises to Julia, who says that she would not desert Vanessa if it weren’t for Donna. They each have their own responsibilities and Julia’s right now is to take care of Vanessa.</p><p>In Cephalonia, Donna Troy is walking the streets with the local Governor, Foundas. He explains that he doesn’t want another incident just like when Wonder Woman was here. A man then runs up called Liguisos and accuses him for covering up another danger from this island. He replies that this is none of their concern, and Liguisos replies that this is a concern of all of them. Wonder Woman had saved their island, which the Governor didn’t solve. Or perhaps he had been paid off by Ventouras? The Governor replies that there hadn’t been any danger until Wonder Woman arrived. Liguisos replies that he is hiding something, and that is why he wants Troia to leave. An angry crowd forms and goes for the Governor when Troia throws up a force field. A man with a walking stick advances, but a golden lasso stops the walking stick from hitting them. Everyone turns and sees Wonder Woman. She tells them to go home, and tells them that Donna is a friend. The crowd disperses and Donna, impressed, tells her that she certainly has a way with people. Diana smiles at Donna and tells them that she is a friend, even though they have never met until today. They make their way to the house of Julia Kapatelis’ parents and they talk for hours, and a bond is instantly formed. Diana then asks Donna if she had heard someone speaking in Greek. Donna thinks for a bit and remembers a voice as well, thinking it was Diana. Diana responds that there is a connection with Circe and her Demon Scourge that the Titans had dealt with recently. Donna wonders why Circe had been after her. Diana has no answers, at least not for now. Circe is a complete mystery, being able to puzzle the Gods themselves. Suddenly, the both of them hear a scream. They run outside and see an overturned van and realises the van being owned by Gregori Davalos, who led the rebels. Diana rips away the door and sees Gregori injured. He warns them to watch out for Andros. They ask who he is, when they see a werebeast behind them, growling and confronting them!</p>",,,,,,,False,33294,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/15776/6135571-ww47a.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",47,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55847/', 'id': 55847, 'name': 'Greece', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/greece/4020-55847/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/massachusetts/4020-55745/'}]",Common Ground,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41435/', 'id': 41435, 'name': 'Lasso of Truth', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56631/', 'id': 56631, 'name': 'Talaria', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/talaria/4055-56631/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51517/', 'id': 51517, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Bracelets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-bracelets/4055-51517/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56852/', 'id': 56852, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Earrings"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-earrings/4055-56852/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51489/', 'id': 51489, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Tiara"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2913/', 'id': 2913, 'name': 'George Pérez', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/george-perez/4040-2913/', 'role': 'writer, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-15787/', 'id': 15787, 'name': 'Jill Thompson', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jill-thompson/4040-15787/', 'role': 'penciler'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-29307/', 'id': 29307, 'name': 'Julianna Ferriter', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/julianna-ferriter/4040-29307/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43437/', 'id': 43437, 'name': 'Karen Berger', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/karen-berger/4040-43437/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14639/', 'id': 14639, 'name': 'Romeo Tanghal', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/romeo-tanghal/4040-14639/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42589/', 'id': 42589, 'name': 'Tom Peyer', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tom-peyer/4040-42589/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman-47-common-ground/4000-33294/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-61593/', 'id': 61593, 'name': 'Beastiamorphs', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/beastiamorphs/4060-61593/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-19081/', 'id': 19081, 'name': 'Teen Titans', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/teen-titans/4060-19081/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-3824/', 'id': 3824, 'name': 'Wonder Woman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman/4050-3824/'}"

What will happen in this issue, with Circe returning more powerful than ever?!</p><p><b><i>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead!</i></b></p><p>Circe asks Wonder Woman if this is what she had mind - her being the one being involved with her dreams. She continues on, saying that this is merely the beginning. Finding Donna Troy was never the solution to getting rid of her nightmares. Andros, the man recently turned into a man-beast leaps for Donna Troy. Diana tells her get out of the way, but Donna is too late and it makes contact with her, tackling her to the ground. Diana tackles the beast off from Donna herself but is beaten down. The beast turns its attention to the van, and Donna makes a forcefield around Gregori and herself. Donna tells Diana that she can't fight the beast and create this forcefield, so she will have to use her lasso to tie the beast up. Gregori yells that the only way to stop Andros is to kill him, but Wonder Woman thinks that there must be another way to stop him. Diana grabs Andros' throat and applies pressure to a pressure point and renders him unconscious. They bring him back to Gregori's hideout where Donna apologises for freezing when they got attacked. Diana says it's fine, because she had had a similar experience with her lasso and one of those beasts. Diana then realises that Andros was merely a boy and chastises Gregori for asking her to kill him. Gregori replies that he wasn't thinking clearly and it was an act of desperation. The boy, now conscious, starts weeping because of the curse which plagues him. He wishes that he was free from Circe's curse. Upon hearing the name, Diana demands to know where she is hiding. Gregori tells her that she had left Cephalonia. Gregori says that he and Andros had been foolish to think that the curse had been truly broken. He had been trying to get in contact with Donna and Diana for a while now.</p><p>In New York City, Theo and Anna have been digging at a certain site. They have been digging for hours now and Anna thinks that this is perhaps the wrong site. Theo says that it isn't; this is exactly what the Titans described. Just then, he finds something and then says that perhaps the witch is not immortal after all. He says once they're finished here, they can finish off Circe for sure this time. They have dug up a stone door, and behind that, is the object that will help them defeat Circe. Together, they transform into Centaur and Cat.</p><p>Donna and Diana are flying to a man named Theophilos Ventouras. Donna asks Diana whether this is the best plan. He did after all lead Circe's werebeasts against her, and this may be a trap if they meet up. Diana suggests that Donna is free to go home, but she refuses, saying that a Titan always stands up to what they are up against. After all, she wants to see what the resolve is. And after that, they can get to the niceties as her husband, Terry is very anxious to meet Diana. Donna cannot wait to meet Julia and Vanessa Kapatelis and her Amazonian sisters.</p><p>On Themyscira, the Amazons Euboea, Philippus visit Hippolyta. A little distracted, Hippolyta apologises for doing so and Pythia asks if she's concerned about Diana. Hippolyta says that she and is concerned about Diana's dreams. She has never had nightmares to the degree of what she is going through right now. Philippus suggests she go speak with the oracle, Menalippe, but Hippolyta refuses, saying that she has her own problems to deal with. However, Pythia agrees with Philippus says that she really should go see Menalippe about Diana's dreams. Later on, Hippolyta arrives at the temple and greets Penelope, asking how Menalippe goes. Hippolyta points out that she certainly been focusing on her praying ever since the Gods left them.</p><p>In the sewers, Theo and Anna make their way into the room with the artifact. He then hears his name being called and turns around to see Donna and Diana. Theo tells them to leave. He will not have her stop them. He has spent too much time researching this to get here. He then recounts his adventure in researching and finding this place: He had remembered making his way into Circe's library, researching information and finding a way to get rid of Circe. Then, Wonder Woman had come to Cephalonia and he thought that she would be able to get rid of Circe, but she didn't. If it hadn't been for Wonder Woman, Julia Kapatelis may have been able to kill Circe! But Wonder Woman had stopped Julia from shooting Circe. He then saw Circe disappear in the light and he was angry with the rebels who thought that Wonder Woman had killed Circe. He then found out that his younger brother, Andros, had gone to join a cult which believed that Wonder Woman had killed Circe. If they only they really knew. Him and his lover, Anna, had moved to New York and he had stopped turning in those werebeasts. One night while working, he had saw the hair on his hands, and he ran home to see Anna turned into a cat. They then read of Donna in New York battling the Scourge. Donna and Diana acknowledge this name. Wonder Woman then explains that Circe had gone to Qurac to learn about turning men into beasts. She then realises something else that Theo wrote down, something that she didn't understand. But now she does, and that is the antidote! Theo remembers telling Andros to go retrieve his notes, but Gregori had already found out about them, and told Andros to tell Diana and Donna to help Theo. Wonder Woman tells Theo there is no cure; it is all lies. Just then, Anna comes out and apologises for not being able to defeat Circe. Wonder Woman says it is obvious that Circe wanted them all in one place so that she could get rid of them. Circe appears on the monitor and says that they cannot defeat her. And they were fools to think so in the first place. Just then, the ship begins to fall apart, and Wonder Woman suggest that they hurry and leave. Donna then points out skeletons and Diana uses her lasso to break one of the skeletons in half, but the bottom half just keeps advancing. Theo tells them to leave, as he is the one Circe really wants. A skeleton then attacks Theo. Anna attacks the skeleton that attacks Theo, but she herself pays the price when another skeleton attacks her torso. In a rage, Theo throws off the skeleton and attacks it.</p><p>Wonder Woman and Donna are too busy fighting their own group of enemies. As Theo is impaled by the skeleton, he smashes the skeleton's head. He tells them both that destroying their heads will finish them for good. With Anna gone, Donna asks why Theo had sacrificed himself like this, and Wonder Woman replies that he merely wanted to be with her. Donna tends to Anna and tells her that she can go to healers on Paradise Island, but Anna tells her that it's over now. Anna tells her that Theo never realised what he was sacrificing when he wanted to remove the curse; he was sacrificing his so much to become human. Donna turns around to see Theo in his real form, which is a horse! Donna and Diana bury the both of them, and Diana wonders if Anna had led him here on purpose because she couldn't tell him the truth, that he would never turn into a normal human. Later, Diana apologises for not this not being the best meeting so could have hoped for. They both realise that they need to part their ways. They both hug, and Donna reassures Diana that they will no doubt meet in the future.</p><p>Diana makes his back home to the Kapatelis house and greets Julia, apologising for not talking to Vanessa just yet. She asks if Vanessa has been talking yet, and Julia says that she has been talking a little, but before she can go to Vanessa, there are some visitors in the lounge room. Diana walks in to see Donna and her husband Terry. And a surprise, Donna's stepsister, Cindy. She thought that Vanessa could do with another friend, seeing as they are the same age. Cindy and Vanessa are upstairs talking, and Cindy says that she understands Vanessa because Donna had to go out on missions all the time. She understands the fear that Vanessa is going through. But it is Donna's job, being a big time superheroine and all. Vanessa replies that Diana always says she's not a hero - at least it's what she says. She then asks Cindy how she deals with it. Cindy replies that Donna had asked her if she would be happier if Donna had not been in her life. Cindy replied that she would rather know Donna, even with the risks it involves.

Diana's friends and colleagues, and recapping her adventures to date.</em></p><p>An issue recounting the events of Wonder Woman in a special news report.</p><p><b><i>Plot synopsis -- spoilers ahead</i></b></p><p>A special report shows the beginning of Wonder Woman and how she came about in Boston which has led to the U.N. Summit that is to be attended by Queen Hippolyta and includes special spotlights on Julia Kapatelis and Steve Trevor. Ronnie Sarasky, the reporter then talks about the attack of the Silver Swan and then asks different heroes who worked with her during the alien invasion. Donna Troy then gets a mention and Diana says that they had so much in common, they could've been sisters, and it turns out they were! They discovered that Donna Troy was also given powers by the Gods, in this case, the Titans and was named Troia. Sarasky then turns her attention to Superman. Superman explains that when he first saw her, he thought she was just another superhero but then ended up having a large amount of respect for her. Sarasky then brings out a photo of the both of them kissing, and Superman responds to that, saying that they are merely good friends. The both of them decided that they would keep their relationship professional.</p><p>Sarasky then talks to Lois about the delegates visiting Paradise Island and the commotion that Eris caused, which has led to Hippolyta going to the U.N. Summit. Julia Kapatelis then says that they will give her a gift, which is an ancient artifact which is from the ruins of Themyscira. Wonder Woman goes on to explain how her mother will be sure to accept it this time. The report finishes; will Hippolyta enjoy ""Man's World""? Or will she see it more dangerous than before? And will Wonder Woman still be seen as the special Amazon? What will make her special if Amazons become common? Maybe because she has a special place in all of everybody's heart!</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""With acknowledgements to Len Wein and Mindy

Festivities and preparations galore as Queen Hippolyte and the Amazons journey to man's world.</em></p><p>Man's World and the Amazons meet at last!</p><p>Queen Hippolyta prays to the gods as the sun rises, Cydippe calls her back into the temple. Hippolyta talks about how times they have seen the sun go down, and remembers the day when her daughter, Diana was born. Cydippe comments on how depressed Hippolyta seems right now; Hippolyta replies that she is a little nervous. Cydippe then asks Hippolyta how the talk with Menalippe went. Hippolyta replies that everything went fine, though she realises that there is something missing in Menalippe's eyes. Perhaps their pilgrimage will bring back whatever is missing in her.</p><p>The both of them ride back to the temple to being the pilgrimage. Menalippe performs a ceremony for the Summit, and begins the ceremony by blessing the Amazons who are about to enter Man's World. They all salute with the Amazonian salute as their bracelets ""clank"" together. An Amazon, Niobe, comments on how Menalippe sounds, as if she has lost all energy to speak properly like she used to. Penelope replies Menalippe has been doing this for a long time now. Niobe says that Menalippe had faith in the gods because she was sure they were still there to hear her; right now, Menalippe going to Man's World doesn't seem right. Penelope, with a concerned look on her face asks Niobe if she feels that Menalippe is not fit to be an oracle? Hellene joins the conversation, hoping to tone down the tension. She urges everyone to calm down; there is no need to fight, because it is a stressful time now. Iphthime joins as well and supports Hellene, adding that while others may seem positive about all this, she is still skeptical. Hippolyta interrupts and tells them just how desperately they need to get themselves out there. She turns to Diana, and tells her to tell Man's World that the Amazons are coming to Man's World! Later that morning, Myrrha hands Diana her travelling bag, and Diana admits to the nervousness. Menalippe tells Diana that there is no need to be nervous. Diana then hugs her mother goodbye and flies off.</p><p>The next day, at New York, the city hears of the coming Amazons and the excitement is certainly in the air. Vanessa Kapatelis watches all of it below from the hotel room above. She asks Diana if Hippolyta will understand all this, and Diana replies that she is sure she will. Julia then steps in the room with her new outfit and tells Vanessa that her own outfit is in her room. Vanessa, excited, goes inside to change. Diana comments on Vanessa's happiness. Julia agrees that Vanessa has been happier these days, though feels guilty for spending too much time away from her daughter and feels that Vanessa hasn't had the chance to have a normal childhood. Julia realises what she has implied and apologises. Diana says it is fine. Since she was born to bring these two cultures - Amazons and Man's World - together, it is soon going to be complete, and what will she do next? She cannot keep bringing herself into Julia's and Vanessa's life, and keep bringing them to danger. Julia replies, and says that it okay. She does not regret adventures they have gone through together. She then asks Diana if she has asked her mother what she thinks of this. Diana replies and says that she does not know. Julia tells her that she is insulting Hippolyta and her if she thinks she does not have to tell her. Diana replies and says she does not honestly know. She then goes to the phone to call Donna Troy. Terry answers on the other side. Diana, surprised, asks where Donna is. Terry replies by saying that she is on one of her missions, and that she has been gone for a few days, so they might not be able to attend the banquet. Diana hangs up and wonders if Donna is alright; Terry sounded very concerned on the phone, and hoped that Donna would be able to meet Hippolyta. Vanessa then steps out of the room with her new outfit; Julia is taken aback by how beautiful she looks. Diana bids goodbye as she has one more thing to do.</p><p>At the Air Force base in Massachusetts, Etta Candy watches the TV on the reports of the Summit, and is glad she is able to attend. She makes her way to the corridor, hoping to miss General Yedziniak on the way out, but he catches her before she can leave. He tells her to report for duty tomorrow morning. Etta reminds him that she has the Summit to attend, and the General retorts back, saying that they have spent enough time focusing on the ""foreigners"". She wonders how she is going to tell Steve about his now.</p><p>In Oklahoma, Wonder Woman speaks to Hermes out in the farming field. Wonder Woman comments on Hermes looking so weary. Hermes replies, saying that this experience as a mortal has been an interesting one, one that he has underestimated. Wonder Woman suggests that he become a god again, and hold the Caduceus. He should use his powers to lead the Amazons to the turning point of their destiny. Hermes refuses, saying that it is important for her to keep it. Wonder Woman refuses as well. She says that the gods have left them, and she will not let Hermes leave them as well. She mentions Menalippe, and how she has lost faith in the gods now. Diana reminds him that it would be better if he held the Caduceus. With that Hermes holds out his hands which causes a glowing energy to form around Wonder Woman's belt, where the Cadeceus' symbol is kept. A transformation then takes place.</p><p>At Ed Indelicato's apartment, he packs his bags as he too is going to New York to attend the Summit. His detective partner, Mike Shands teases him about his novel, in which Ed mentions Wonder Woman many times.</p><p>At Metropolis, Clark Kent sits at his desk and reads the newspaper report on the Summit. He wonders if he should should call her, for the sake of catching up on old times. A work mate of his comes up to him and asks why he isn't at the Summit as well. He replies that Lois had been chosen for reporting on the story. On the TV is Lois, being interviewed by another reported who asks about the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, and how they plan to outdo the Feast of Five. Lois confirms that and says that security has also increased, to stop any intruders coming through, hopefully preventing the chaos that Eris caused. It is also rumoured that Superman is to attend, though nobody is sure how many superheroes who are coming has been confirmed.</p><p>At the Justice League headquarters, Guy Gardner turns off the television, disproving of this Summit. Fire agrees. Black Canary tells them to be quiet; she tells that Diana wants them to be apart of it. Red Rocket and Martian Manhunter agree. They had allowed her to join without considering her own diplomatic duties. What they are doing is only fair.</p><p>On Themyscira, the Amazons have gone to sleep, and Menalippe hears a voice. She opens her eyes to find Hermes standing in front of her, in his god gear, holding his Cadeceus. She bows and blames the lack of faith of the gods had allowed Eris to cause the trouble she had planned. Hermes holds her head up, telling her that is was not her fault. She starts to sob, but Hermes hugs her, and tells her that it is not her fault. Menalippe straightens herself up and her tears stop. At New York, Diana looks up into the sky and sees a new star shine. Diana smiles, knowing that Menalippe has been saved.</p><p>At dawn, Lois reports on the energy of the many people there, saying that there is a lot of buzz in the air. Etta, Steve, Vanessa and Julia attend. Etta asks Steve on how he got General Yedziniak to let her go. Steve explains that General Hilary owed him a favour, and Hilary outranks Yedziniak. Asmund Lindel then steps up to the podium to say a speech. He talks of the privilege he was allowed to visit their island. He speaks of positive things of the island; peace and love, without any hate. Diana, in her hotel room, continues to listen to the speech. She adjusts her cloak, when a familiar voice offers her help adjusting it. Wonder Woman turns around and smiles at Superman. He gives her a pep talk, and flies out the window. Diana then continues listening to Asmund's speech, and on cue, she flies out the window, where the crowds roar. She touches down near the podium, and the crowd is quiet. They wait for her to say something, but just then, Hermes flies out from the river and uses his Cadeceus to create a portal, which many Amazons walk through with Hippolyta leading. As Hippolyta is about to make her first step on Man's World, she stops and raises her arms. Wonder Woman assumes they are to do the Amazonian salute, but instead, they remove their bracelets instead, dropping them on the floor. Artemis had chained them to their bracelets, to remind them to never make a mistake again. Up until now, they realise that those days of fear are over. The Amazons step onto the stage and the crowd roars once again. The crowd then falls silent. She steps up to the podium, and thanks them for inviting them. Asmund then tells Hippolyta that they would like to give a gift; Julia then stands up and gives them a casket and asks the queen to accept their gift. Hippolyta opens it, to find an object, the Goblet of Heracles inside. Hippolyta is confused by such a cup; Oracle explains that it was the day that Heracles drug them. Asmund then explains that that cup was used to deceive them, and so today, let it be that that cup illustrate their trust for each other. Wine is poured and the both of them drink from it. Hippolyta says to crowd that she wishes the same things as Asmund, and with that, she salutes. The crowd roars and Wonder Woman hugs her mother, overwhelmed by all this peace. There will no doubt be problems in the future, but for now, they celebrate the peace.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>""Dedicated to the memory of Wonder Woman's creator William Moulton Martson and artist H.

She is standing on the beach when all of a sudden she is shot at with an arrow, she reflects the arrow with her Bracelets of the Aegis  (she deducts that the arrow is an amazonian craftsmanship). Helen and Mala run up to see her soon after and inform her that they have been at war. Princess Diana is able to see the destruction caused by the Daemons.  <br /> <br />Once at the Royal Palace she is able to talk to her mother about the war and everything that has been occurring while she was gone. Her mother explains to her that the war was lead by Amazonians led by her sister.  As her mother keeps telling her the story Wonder Woman is shocked all this could have occurred in  only a few months while she was gone. But her mother then informs her that she has been gone for TEN YEARS. This leads to a discussion how she feels Diana is not  qualified to be Wonder Woman anymore because of her lack of Amazonian morals and values (her mother says Earth has changed her).  <br /> <br />Later on, while on a walk with Mala, Diana and her are shot at by another arrow.

Princess Diana is not happy with the idea of this and does not understand why they would want to find someone to replace her. Hippolyta then goes on to explain how Wonder Woman has left her home to be on Earth and that Earth has changed her values and everything she has learned in Themyscria. Diana Strongly disagrees with her mother and says that Earth is a Dangerous place and she is just doing what she feels is best to take care of the people. But Hippolyta makes it very clear that the contest is on and if she does not want to participate in it she can forfeit he costume and office.</p><p>After talking to her mother, Princess Diana goes to change into normal clothes because she does not feel that she is fitted to wear the uniform right now. They then walk through the city discussing the last contest and how everyone competed but only one was not able to, Wonder Woman (and whoever was to win would become mortal). The issue Then goes on to explain the story of Wonder Woman in brief and how she was the only child born to Themyscira and was given to her mother by the gods, to fill the void left in her heart by the loss of her sister, Antiope. But that Princess Diana did find a way to compete by using <b>the Mask of Proteus</b> so she can compete. And then later wins. After Mala and Princess Diana finish discussing all of this they run into Artemis, who is upset because her tribe has been informed they are not allowed to compete in the competition.</p><p>Princess Diana follows Artemis so she can truly understand what happen and why they are no longer one tribe. As she follows her into her village Artemis introduces her tribe has the last of the true Amazonians. Once in the Village, Artemis' presence is requested by an old woman but the name of Mala who is missing an eye do to a demon. The only women wanted to see Artemis because she had heard word of her having a visitor with her. When the old one recognizes who she is. She says she never believed the legend until now.</p><p>Princess Diana is not aware of what is going on but the old woman leads her and Artemis into a room where there is a bust of Princess Diana. Wonder Woman is shocked when she sees this and does not know how to take it. She then goes to touch the bust of herself and is sent to another dimension where is has become Antiope.</p><p>The next scene is Antiope/Wonder Woman and Hippolyta talking about how she is going to marry Herakles. Antiope thinks this is a horrid idea because mean are not suppose to be on the island. Hippolyta ignores the thoughts of her sister and marries him anyway--all the other women are married to one of his men. In the evening Antiope becomes aware of the Herakles's plan to enslave all the women, but she is too late. Herakles has already tired up her sister. He tricks Antiope by using the Mask of Proteus. Herakles and Antiope then fight until she is knocked out. At that point Wonder Woman reappears in the room with the old woman and Artemis unconscious and badly beaten.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p><ul><li>As for story chronology, this issue actually takes place between issues <a href=""/wonder-woman-90-the-contest-begins/4000-39621/"" data-ref-id=""4000-39621"">#90</a> and <a href=""/wonder-woman-91-immortal-combat/4000-39913/"" data-ref-id=""4000-39913"">#91</a> and is part two of the five part story arc ""<em>The Contest</em>"".

As everyone is on the beach Princess Diana has another one of her flashbacks (they occur in issue #0; this one ties into what occurred in that issue) and sees everything that occurred between her mother, Herakles, and Antiope. Hours late she wakes up on the beach. When she wakes up she starts questioning everything she has been told and wonders what her mother's true actions were all those years ago.</p><p> </p><p>The next day the competition continues and Hippolyta does something out of her character, she has the girls compete in a battle against one another (similar to that of capture the flag), they are divided into two teams. As the game comes to an end Princess Diana finds herself being shot at by another arrow but is not in any condition to stop the arrow herself...who will save her?</p>",,,,,,,False,39913,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/35746-3824-39913-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",91,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/massachusetts/4020-55745/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56187/', 'id': 56187, 'name': 'Themyscira', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/themyscira/4020-56187/'}]",Immortal Combat!,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41435/', 'id': 41435, 'name': 'Lasso of Truth', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51517/', 'id': 51517, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Bracelets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-bracelets/4055-51517/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-30811/', 'id': 30811, 'name': 'Bill Messner-Loebs', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bill-messner-loebs/4040-30811/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9976/', 'id': 9976, 'name': 'Brian Bolland', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/brian-bolland/4040-9976/', 'role': 'cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-44123/', 'id': 44123, 'name': 'Jason Hernandez-Rosenblatt', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jason-hernandez-rosenblatt/4040-44123/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-21341/', 'id': 21341, 'name': 'Mike Deodato, Jr.', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mike-deodato-jr/4040-21341/', 'role': 'artist, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-44124/', 'id': 44124, 'name': 'Paul Kupperberg', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/paul-kupperberg/4040-44124/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-20722/', 'id': 20722, 'name': 'Trish Mulvihill', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/trish-mulvihill/4040-20722/', 'role': 'colorist'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman-91-immortal-combat/4000-39913/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-42494/', 'id': 42494, 'name': 'Amazons of Themyscira', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-46084/', 'id': 46084, 'name': 'The Bana', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-bana/4060-46084/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-3824/', 'id': 3824, 'name': 'Wonder Woman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman/4050-3824/'}"

Because she is not in he position to catch the arrow or reflect it Artemis jumps in from of it and grabs it, saving Wonder Woman's life. Mala says the arrow came from the wooded area but none of the women see anything.</p><p>The story then jumps to Boston, where we see Mrs. Sazia surrounded by mob members threatening to kill her but she gives them an ultimatum and ask if they want to join her team---the majority of the men jump to the idea of having a female boss after seeing her biomechanical contrust, which she stole from S.T.A.R Lab.</p><p>We then return to Themyscria, where we find out the four winners from the battle/war competition--both Princess Diana and Artemis are still in the competition. Artemis is shocked that everyone is cheering for them since they have ""been humiliated"" by losing but Princess Diana explains that they are a sisterhood and they were only competing for fun. Later that evening Artemis is in the woods yelling at Patrice about shooting the arrow at Wonder Woman.</p><p>The issue then goes on to show a conversation between Phillipus and Hippolyta, discussing the final part of the competition the next day. Hippolyta wants to use areas that ave mystical powers in them so the girls have to deal with more than just the elements of the island. Phillipus finds his to be a poor idea on Hippolyta's part, but since she is queen Phillipus must hold her tongue.</p><p>In the morning they start the competition by swimming into the ocean and then swimming back to shore, once the majority of them have reached the point of turning around a whirlpool opens up sucking them under. Princess Diana sees that Mala is sinking and might not make it but she is out of breath and unable to save her so Artemis does. As she is under the water she has another one of her flashbacks causing her to down.</p><p>While in the flashback as Antiope, she becomes aware of how her mother told Herakles that he could become king if he promised not to be violent. When Antiope is being choked by Herakles, Hippolyta hits him with a vase causing him to be knocked unconscious. Antiope then uses the mask to take the form of Herakles an tells all of his men to leave the island. After this incident Antiope leaves Themysrica because her sister has betrayed her.</p><p>Once Wonder Woman woke from the flashback she finds herself on shore--thanks to Artemis. They continue the race. They then encounter Harpies as the competition furthers--but that's nothing wonder woman can't handle. She is not in third place and does not know how she can catch up to Artemis and Venelia. AS she gets closer she sees that Venelia has been turned into stone....this can only be the work of Medus.

With the events of Boston and Paradise Island behind her, Diana takes up residence in a new location, Gateway City, to start her life anew…and finds herself immediately drawn into Darkseid's quest to learn the fate of the old gods!</em></p><p>In the aftermath of <em>The Contest</em> and <em>The Challenge of Artemis</em>, Diana decides to make a new life for herself in Gateway City. One night, while flying around the city, she comes upon a bank heist in progress. She is caught off guard by their technologically advanced weaponry, but recovers and apprehends the would-be bank robbers. A few days later Mike Schorr, a police officer investigating these high tech weapons, walks into a dive bar, looking for information. The patrons consist of criminals enjoying a brief reprieve from the prison cells that await their inevitable return. They are uncooperative and become violent. Officer Schorr is outnumbered and taking a beating before Wonder Woman rescues him. They team up and locate a hidden door. Opening it reveals an underground passage. While wandering through the tunnels, Diana is troubled by the fact that the advanced technology feels strangely familiar, but she cannot recall when she encountered it before. Suddenly they are attacked by a giant, mechanical spider and surrounded by Parademons. Despite a valiant effort by Wonder Woman and Officer Schorr, the pair suffer defeat and taken prisoner.

The War hits Wonder Woman hard. Witness the battle from Diana's point of view and the terrible pain she suffers at the hand of Imperiex.</em></p><p>An Our Worlds At War tie-in the issue starts with Hippolyta surveying the Paradocs (the medical bay of a large alien ship) searching for Diana. She grows increasingly more panicked until Cassie Sandsmark, Wonder Girl II, tells Hippolyta where she can find her daughter. The former Amazon Queen arrives in time to see Superman flying in with a badly burned Wonder Woman. Cassie calls for a burn team as Wonder Woman goes into convulsions. </p><p>In her mind, Diana wonders where she is and what's happening to her body. Her memories ""twist and slide"" as she remembers the new Cheetah, her friend Vanessa, and Circe. Other memories like Kansas being destroyed, Superman fighting Zod over Berlin, and Imperiex attacking, begin to surface. She remembers the probes sent to ""hollow"" the earth, Darkseid and Apokolips joining forces with Earth, and the carnage the probes caused. She recalls destroying a probe and it exploding. </p><p>Her convulsions continue and she accidentally hits a doctor sending him flying across the room. Hippolyta tells Diana to remember the skills she gave her, and to move her body through the pain. To focus her spirit beyond the physical. Hippolyta orders Cassie to get her pack. Inside are salves they use to soothe and heal her skin. </p><p>They get word the J.S.A. was successful in their mission to destroy Imperiex's command ship. Hippolyta notes the alien computers saying Diana is healing at an accelerated rate and that Epione would go mad because she doesn't trust machines. Hippolyta tells Diana she misses her and that she knows she doesn't agree with the changes she's made. She hopes one day Diana could accept her as a peer and not a nuisance. A woman named Julia overhears and tells Hippolyta that Diana rescued her from slavery and gave her a name. An alert sounds and two Imperiex probes attack. Hippolyta turns to Diana and she's staggering on her feet ready to fight. She then puts her to sleep praying to Morpheus. </p><p>Hippolyta goes out in space to attack but the probes ignore her and continue building another Hollower. She hits one to get it's attention and they fight for a page. Before she destroys it, it manages to send the half completed probe toward Earth. </p><p>Inside the Paradocs Green Lantern is having trouble containing various hull breaches. Diana calms him and tells him he can do it. He seals them with some conjured up super glue. Lantern tells Diana that Hippolyta went out to stop the probe. Hippolyta thinks back to when Artemis gave her The Sandals of Hermes and the Gauntlet of Atlas then goes to try and stop the Hollower.</p><p>Hippolyta notices the Hollower heading towards Athens and has flashbacks of her saying good bye to her best friend Phillipus. Her armor starts melting and she thinks she's dying. Diana shows up and tries to get her mother to stop. The other Imperiex probe appears and attacks Diana. After a short fight Hippolyta yells at Diana to use her bracelets. Hippolyta uses her Lasso to cut the probes head off which results in an enormous explosion destroying the probe and the Hollower. </p><p>Hippolyta crashes to the ground hard. Seeing this and thinking it's Diana, Superman rushes to help. Diana rises from the crater her impact caused and knocks people over to get to her mother.

The Fates, as they are referred to, narrate almost the entire issue. They make note of Imperiex's responsibility for Hippolyta's death. The anger within Diana as she is forced to ally with Darkseid, the evil ruler of Apokolips. They observe Earth and the hidden Warworld.  <br /> <br />     Wonder Woman, Superman, and Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner) shatter Imperiex's body in space scattering it's energy. An energy burst makes it seem Earth is attacking Apokolips thus ending the alliance between Darkseid and Earth. A Boom Tube releases hoards of Parademons and an angered Superman fights Darkseid to a near standstill. Now under control of Brainiac 13, Warworld attacks.  <br /> <br />    Wonder Woman, Superman, Captain Marvel and Earth's other powerful heroes attack Warworld. A tendril linking Warworld and Apokolips fades the fire pits of the latter. Another tendril launches with Earth as it's target. Maxima tries to intercept but Brainiac is ready and destroys her ship killing her and everyone else on it. Now joined with Steel in the Entropy Aegis armor, Superman and Diana form a plan.  <br /> <br />     Wonder Woman, Donna Troy and Starfire travel to Paradise Island to meet with Phillipus and inform her of Hippolyta's death. Phillipus and Artemis summon all of the Amazons to help. Steve Trevor absorbs the Wonderdome and the Amazons use Paradise Island to block the newly forming tendril. Diana leads the Amazons, protected by the pieces of the Wonderdome, as they attack Warworld.  <br /> <br />     Darkseid's Shock Troopers appear, the same type that invaded Paradise Island in the past, and attack the Amazons. Starfire stops them as she explains that they need them to stop Brainiac. Diana lands on Apokolips and tells Darkseid they need his help to destroy Warworld.  <br /> <br />     With Darkseid's powers all ready exhausted, Wonder Woman gathers all the Amazons and together they pray. The Shock Troopers now protect the Amazons as they focus all of their energy and spiritual power as it's channeled into Darkseid by Raven.  Apokolips explodes back to life as Darkseid's powers are replenished. He starts to attack with his Omega Beams but Superman contacts Diana and warns her not to destroy Warworld. Superman goes on to explain that Imperiex hasn't been destroyed but instead his energy has been trapped in Warworld and destroying it would free him.  <br /> <br />     They form a plan to recalibrate Lexcorp Tower's Temporal Discharge Cannon to the Beginning of time. Darkseid uses Tempest and Steel to create a big enough Boom Tube for Superman to push Warworld through. Darkseid then tells Diana that after all he's done to their Island in the past they've lost a piece of their soul to him when they gave him strength through prayer.

with captivity.</em></p><p>The battle from the issue #32 is over and Wonder Woman is on a horse. Nehebka asks if Wonder Woman is alright. Even though they have survived a massacre, Wonder Woman asks if this is justified. They were only after Cheetah yet so many innocents died. Wonder Woman tells the Bana-Mighdall Amazons that perhaps this is the work of butches, not warriors. If she had only gotten here earlier. Her medicine was inadequate and she was too weak to pray to the Gods to help her. She then asks why the did not kill when they had the chance. Nehebka replies that the queen's last wish was to <em>not</em> kill her.</p><p>Meanwhile in a small shop police are investigating a crime scene. A man is dead while a woman tells them that a ""she-demon"" has killed him. One of the officers find a torn up photo of Wonder Woman and the woman tells them that she was the woman who had killed Cheetah and ended the bloodshed.</p><p>Back at Bana-Mighdall, Cheetah is imprisoned in a padded cell. Wonder Woman looks down at her and Cheetah is still in her barbaric state. Wonder Woman remembers Chuma telling her that Cheetah should return to her normal state by dawn, but it had been hours before that and she is still in her Cheetah form. Wonder Woman asks for forgiveness as she never meant to be so violent seeing as she was someone who represented peace. Then, an Amazon wearing an eye-patch walks in and she introduces herself in Faruka, in English. She introduces herself as Faruka, the one who called Julia and the former assistant to the chief priest – who Diana murdered. Wonder Woman tries to explain that she died from an accident, but Faruka isn't having any of it.</p><p>Wonder Woman says that she has been referred to ""Ariadna"" ever since and says that it sounds familiar but she does not know what it means. Cheetah rants back to Faruka, and she replies by pulling out a revolver but Wonder Woman grabs her arm from doing so. Queen Anahid had ordered Wonder Woman to be kept alive only so she could be killed by Faruka. She still thinks that the sacrilege is not resolved! Wonder Woman snaps back lecturing her about Bana-Mighdall society itself. She assures Faruka that Barbara Minerva will be punished, but not by them! She must do so – to honour a man named Chuma.</p><p>In a town called Bahafara, a man is driving Dr. Osman Suakin to the police station. His friend who is driving can't understand why he is helping an American. He replies that Professor Kapatelis had helped him understand the world much better. He is then greeted by Hussain and his men and fills Osman in on what has happened. Apparently, there have been many ""she-devils"". Hassain explains that at first he did not believe the people who have been claiming this but after they found dead bodies of women, naked and beheaded, they started believing. Osman then asks about the torn photograph and Hassain asks if he knows who that woman is standing next to Wonder Woman. Osman replies that he does, and that is why the reason why he is here.</p><p>Osman, in his hotel room, calls Julia Kapatelis and tells her about the dead bodies. Julia asks if one of the bodies is Wonder Woman, but Osman replies that they are all dark-skinned He also mentions a pygmy who was killed but eaten by vultures – it makes it hard to identify the body. However, Julia knows who it is - Chuma. Vanessa is upstairs, listening in on the conversation through the other phone. Julia tells Osman that she is on the next flight to Cairo. She tells Vanessa that a neighbour will be over taking care of her.</p><p>Back at Bana-Mighdall inside a temple, and Diana notices a strange glow. She walks towards the Girdle of Gaea, and as she does, her lasso glows along with it. Wonder Woman unhooks her lasso's and the girdle's energy combine. Just then, the temple starts shaking. Faruka tells Wonder Woman to step away but she is too transfixed. Not listening to Faruka, she tackles Wonder Woman but the energy surrounding her bounces her back. Guards rush in, ready to tackle Wonder Woman but Nehebka orders them to separate Wonder Woman from the girdle. She then shows Wonder Woman a pile of books and she understands the language that is used here, even though Nehebka does not. Diana reads it, and it seems as if Diana was not the priestess' murderer, but rightful executioner. Faruka however, is unconvinced.</p><p>Nehebka then starts recounting the Bana-Mighdalls' origin story. It was about three millennia ago when a sword fight had happened between King Theseus and an Amazon girl called Phthia. The king's son, Melanippus, and the Captain warned Theseus about this young girl. Melanippus asks what happened and before he can reply, Phthia yells that Theseus is a murderer and he points to the Queen's bedroom. Melanippus was born to a previous spouse, and she had never approved of the current one. Inside was Antiope's body, dead, with a dagger in her heart. The king says that he saw a shadowed body running from the room and does not know if it is Phthia's or not. He was so affected by the murder of Antiope that he did not hear the nurse's screams. Phthia was standing over his infant child looking like she was going to kill the child.</p><p>Phthia says that she was only shielding the baby, and that it had been Theseus of murdered Antiope. He killed her because she learned of his affair with Phaedra. Theseus tries to reason with her but she is not listening and tells him that he was always jealous of Antiope's power. He also wanted to kill Hyppolytus, the child, to end her blood line. Perhaps Melanippus had been right about her all along. Melanippus sent Phthia into the deepest and darkest of jails where she was tortured and Melanippus hopes to finish her off, by executing her. He requests permission to have her executed, but the king argues that Antiope was like a mother towards Phthia and there's no way she could've killed her. Melanippus bounces back saying that Phthia had always blamed men for her mother's death and everything under the sun.</p><p>Theseus hoped to find someone to blame and chose Ariadna, his former wife who he had banished from the kingdom, hoping to marry Antiope.</p><p>Wonder Woman then interrupts the story, saying hat she mentioned Diana's aunty. Faruka says that Diana could not possibly be an Amazon as she is too young, and as she has read from the ancient writings, Queen Hippolyta and her Amazons had been swallowed by the sea. Faruka continues, saying that the Tournament of the Crown will only show who can be Anahid's replacement. Wonder Woman apologises as Nehebka continues with the story.</p><p>Ariadna is found guilty to Antiope's murder and even Phthia's, though many questions raised suspicion, such as how she escaped from her exile and where Phthia's body had disappeared to. During the night when Ariadna was to be executed, the Amazons raided the kingdom, freeing her and from that day on, they knew there would never be peace between Man and Amazon. So from there on, Ariadna's name has meant ""Evil Intruder"" or ""One who must not be trusted"".</p><p>Later on, during the Trojan Wars, an Amazon captain called Penthiselea, who was Phthia's daughter, fought against Captain Eteocles who was Melanippus' son. Penthiselea killed him, and never had revenge tasted so sweet. Wonder Woman disagrees however stating that war is not glorious and that her glory was short-lived. Nehebka acknowledges what Diana says, but they had profited from it. Amazons were the best at battling and they became mercenaries, fighting alongside anyone who offered the right price. They also developed weapons during the time of modernisation and developed the Cobra-dart.</p><p>Meanwhile, the temple shakes again and Nehebka says that it is probably a mystic sandstorm and its coming towards the city. Pointing out from a window, Nehebka spots a light in the middle of the storm. Wonder Woman takes a look herself and is shocked by who it is. It is Hermes, acting how a god <em>shouldn't</em> be acting. He comes in with a booming voice, saying he has come to extract the betrayers of the Amazons.</p>",,,,,,,False,63498,"{'icon_url':

Hermes is soon hit with a bullet and he falls. Wonder Woman places herself between Hermes and the Amazons and they then lower their weapons, to fulfill the wishes of the dead queen. Hermes then says he is here to retrieve the Golden Girdle of Gaea.</p><p>Meanwhile in a temple, Faruka is holding something with a cloth wrapped around it, and mentions something about the New Order finally taking over and that this item was crucial in the plot of Queen Anahid’s death.

Nehebka refuses and says that Wonder Woman is pushing this too far. Wonder Woman replies that she has explained its history and belongs to Hippolyta. Nebekha explains that if that is the case, then Wonder Woman should give them back the lasso because it was forged from the Girdle, but she will not give it back simply because they asked her.</p><p>Not far away, a helicopter flies near the city and uses the Caduceus to help find Wonder Woman. Masat then spots something with his binoculars. The helicopter lands and Masat finds a body of a rebel fanatic named Colonel Hadal and wonders why they were out here in the desert. Masat then claims that this is now military business, and if the Amazon butchers are inside that storm, there is only one way to end this – by bombing it.

Wonder Woman rushes after him with Cheetah in her arms. She seems him enter a building, and an Amazon called Batiri warns Wonder Woman not to enter. Then, Hermes is thrown back out by something inside.</p><p>Wonder Woman then hears the voice of Faruka and accepts the challenge the Faruka has presented to her.

As Shim'Tar throws her punches towards Wonder Woman, she remembers something that Hermes had said: “…never felt such force before...not from anything mortal!” Wonder Woman then springs into action but Shim’Tar fights back and kicks Wonder Woman into a nearby tower.</p><p>Meanwhile, three jet fighters struggle in the sandstorm, when it seems to change direction.</p><p>Back in the city, Shim’Tar manages keep on beating Wonder Woman. Hermes, down below asks Batiri to take him to the Girdle. She agrees and takes him there, but is surprised to find that it has been removed.

Steve appears and is shocked to see his naked state and asks him to wear a bathrobe and where the dove has come from. Hermes explains that it has a brought a message from Princess Diana. Using his powers, he allows for Steve to hear the message and the both of them listen to Diana's recount of recent events...</p><p>The Amazons are preparing for the event and Hippolyta tells Diana that she has put her in an awkward position. As the Amazons are sheltered from the horrors of the outside world, Hippolyta also understands Diana's opinion, who wishes to extend their culture to the outside world which rejected them in the first place.</p><p>Ipthime questions Diana's seriousness – she cannot be serious that she wishes for outsiders to attend the festival. Hippolyta replies that they have allowed men on the island, so why is this any different? Hellene responds that they should wait before allowing others to come. However, Diana reminds her that she had given Diana a chance. She asks whether the Amazons are to be left in yesterday's tragedies, or they can be the Amazons they are and spread their message of love and humanity to the outside world.</p><p>Ipthime replies and says that it appears Diana is a woman of Sparta, wanting the Amazons to go forth into the world with their swords or on them. Diana says that Ipthime twists her words. She responds, urging Diana to think about how the Amazons have not changed for a long time. Can Diana say that the outside world has?</p><p>In Massachusetts, Hermes explains that the rest of the message contains instructions on guiding the United Nation's representative to Themyscira for the Feast of the Five. But Hermes knows there is something more.</p><p>In Harvard University, Julia Kapatelis is reading in the library when Mr. Vicks enters with a letter in his hand. She opens it and is overjoyed by what it contains and rushes out of the room.</p><p>Back on Themyscira, Menalippe tosses and turns in her sleep. Penelope places her hand on Menalippe and urges her to wake up. Then, a charge of energy comes from Menalippe and knocks Penelope unconscious. Upon hearing the noise, Philippus and Euboea dash into the temple. Diana also appears and they find Menalippe next to Penelope and tells them she found her like this after waking up from her meditations. Euboea checks on Penelope. Diana asks Menalippe what she knows of this but Menalippe doesn't know that much. She then asks Diana if the outside world has tainted her trust for the Amazons and suggests that she flies Penelope to the Isle of Healing straight away. As she flying towards the island she wonders why Menalippe was so calm when her friend had been injured. Or maybe she was correct; maybe she was losing her trust in the Amazons. She then sees a dove approaching...</p><p>In Boston, Vanessa Kapatelis and her friend Lucy Spears have finished their English exams and Vanessa dreads that she will not pass her Geometry exam. Lucy asks if Vanessa has asked Diana for help. Vanessa replies that she didn't want to, as she had troubles in Egypt and she had to prepare for the Feast of the Five. It would just seem unfair to unload her problems on her. They say goodbye to each other and Vanessa makes her way to her mother. She then spots Eileen Flowers talking to some scruffy looking man. She calls out to Eileen and her friend gives a cold response. Vanessa just wanted to check if everything was okay and that they were waiting to take her home. Eileen asks coldly whether by ""they"", Vanesses was referring to her and her new friend, Lucy.</p><p>The man then introduces himself as Mike Flowers, Eileen's flower. Vanessa reacts to his appearance and smell and Mike apologises for this and explains that he is the janitor and the incinerator has been broken and has been surrounded by garbage. Vanessa hears her mother call her from the waiting car and she waves goodbye. Mike and Eileen watch Vanessa get into the car and Mike comments on Vanessa, saying that she seems ""kinda flighty"" and Eileen nods in agreement.</p><p>Meanwhile in Themyscira, Wonder Woman makes her way through the storms and lighting and makes her way to Steve's apartment. She asks why there is a hole in the apartment wall and Steve reminds Diana about living with a god. Diana realises that he is talking about Hermes and explains he is not destructive by nature. Steve agrees and explains what has happened. That morning when Hermes received the message, he became pensive. Steve asked him what was wrong and Hermes finally broke down and explained that Hermes was worried about his essence. Steve then understood what he meant as the Caduceus was not as bright as it used to be. Hermes then shot through the roof and he felt that Hermes was perhaps feeling left out. As the God of Messengers, he should be able to pass through its realities but it appears as if the Fates have decreed that this is longer his gift Hermes needed someone to talk to and that is why Steve had sent the messenger back to Themyscira. Only Diana can help him.</p><p>In Beacon Hill, Julia explains to Vanessa that the National Geographics Society has agreed to fund her and this means that they are interested in Julia's theory on the location of the original Themyscira. However, Vanessa seems distracted. Julia wonders if she doesn't want to accompany her and wonders who will take care of Vanessa if she doesn't want to go?</p><p>As they enter the house, Vanessa empties the mail box and is excited because she has been accepted to Camp Monroe and urgently tells Lucy over the phone. Julia then realises that Vanessa has sorted out where she is going to stay while she is away.</p><p>In New Hampshire, Wonder Woman flies searching for Hermes and wonders if he does suffer from maelvolence and there is only one place he would take refuge – his Temple. As she approaches, she sees that it is in ruins with Hermes sitting on the rubble. She watches him as she holds his Caduceus, requesting that his power be returned. He shouts, ""Restore me!"" and energy arcs come from his staff. Wonder Woman prays that his wish is granted but there is an explosion of energy and Hermes is thrown backwards.</p><p>Wonder Woman asks if Hermes is okay, but he lashes out at her, throwing her back. She cannot bear to see Hermes like this so she unhooks her lasso and loops coils around Hermes in order to reveal his true self.</p><p>He stops his rampage and she then hears words of adoration and realises that Julia had been correct all along – that he had feelings for her. She then orders Hermes to release the demons in him and he murmurs, ""Yes"" and he then falls to the ground. He tells her that she can remove the lasso. Hermes replies that Gaea is selfish with her gifts, as the lasso can be corrupted only once and Barbara Minerva had already used that opportunity. He adds that there is nothing sadder in the universe than a fallen god. Diana tells him that he is <i>not</i> a fallen god. He nods and says that he promised to transport the dignitaries for them to attend the festival. He then asks Wonder Woman for her tiara. He uses it to cut himself and Diana is shocked to see blood coming from the wound. He adds that mortals cannot cross the void which is why he was going to guide them.

Plus, delegates from man's world arrive on Paradise Island.</em></p><p>The twelve delegates make their way to Paradise Island. Little do they know that a plan is being hatched...</p><p>News reporters are about to visit Themyscira and a news reporter is informing people about it. She reports how Diana is about to forge past and present into the future and allow outsiders to visit her homeland. Asmund Lindel announced eleven of the twelve delegates to visit Themyscira and the other ten were hand picked by Wonder Woman and Julia Kapatelis. The people chosen were Maritza Nitumbe, Phyllis Haller, Vladimir Morakov, Robert Cantwell, Rabbi Benjamin Hecht, The Reverend Alan Witherspoon, Lin Koo Teng, Rovo Quashi, Henri Claude Tibet and Felix Zumac.</p><p>The reporter adds that the twelfth delegate is a rumour and only Wonder Woman knows. The reporter sends back to the news HQ and continues that they were supposed to be transported by Hermes, but he is no where to be seen. Then it cuts to the Kapatelis home where reporters are asking questions to Julia.</p><p>Meanwhile at the ruins of Hermes’ temple, Hermes tells Wonder Woman that he has reduced his Caduceus to six inches and that he has enhanced winged sandals that he had given her to take the delegates to Themyscira herself. He then fires a blast of energy to her belt and passes some of his power over to her and sees how the Caduceus now forms a part of her belt. She tells him that she can’t accept this gift; it’s blasphemy. Hermes replies that it’s not blasphemy to accept a gift from a God. He then bids her farewell and flies to Steve’s apartment to clear up the mess while Wonder Woman sets off in a opposite direction.</p><p>She heads towards Metropolis and swoops down to the Daily Planet office and sees Superman waiting for her. Up in the sky, they embrace and the people below woo for them and Superman suggests they go somewhere more private. As they fly out towards the countryside, Superman apologises about the public and apologises for the innuendo that annoys Wonder Woman. She replies that Themis finds it offensive and Superman asks who Themis is. She replies that she is the Guardian of the Social Contract between all beings. Her duty is to remind one another with courtesy and respect. Wonder Woman adds that Superman should come to Themyscira as “Clark Kent”. He replies that he cannot attend the Festival of the Five because of his double life but he has another reporter to replace him…</p><p>Later in Boston, Vanessa is speaking to Eileen flowers on the phone and tells her that Lois Lane will be the final delegate. Vanessa goes on to explain that they are the best of friends and that she has not been ignoring her. She also adds how she can’t understand why Eileen is so jealous of Lucy Spears. Vanessa says that she was hanging out with Lucy Spears in hopes of getting good marks so she can go to camp with Lucy instead of Turkey.</p><p>Eileen suggests that if she does not do well, she can always stay with <em>her</em>, but Vanessa replies that she does not want to stay in boring Boston. Just then, Eileen sees Wonder Woman on TV. Vanessa tells Eileen that Julia had been acting so differently ever since she had got her grant and all she ever talks about is her dig in Turkey. Just then, she is interrupted by her mother who waves an envelope in her hand. She tells Vanessa it’s from Mr. Westlake. Vanessa opens her exams and jumps for joy. Eileen realises that her friend will be spending her time with Lucy.</p><p>At the United Nations, Wonder Woman addresses the audience and speaks in her native tongue. Hermes translates for her. Wonder Woman explains that she came from a world hidden by mist for a long time, known only to them by the songs of Homer and by the philosophies of ancient men. She continues on about her time on Paradise Island, as a child who would always bruise her knees and it was them who had taken care of her wounds. Some have called her a feminist, a chauvinist, a Messiah and a few have called her a Goddess. But she rejects these titles, as she is none of these; only a humanist. Hellenic tradition says that there have been four Ages of Humanity, but now it’s time for a fifth, where they all help each other. Wonder Woman then loops her lasso around the twelve delegates and the Caduceus symbol on her belt begins to glow and soon surrounds everyone. Instantly, they are gone.</p><p>Meanwhile on Paradise Island, the Amazons are waiting for Wonder Woman’s arrival. Hellene comments that Diana is late, that the honourable delegates have probably changed their minds. Perhaps the Princess is too ashamed. Queen Hippolyta orders Hellene to be quiet, that everyone had voted a majority for this day to happen. Pythia calms the both of them down, telling that them that they are simply nervous.</p><p>In the city, Menalippe instructs her Amazon sisters to carry their baskets of golden apples and orders them to be spread out evenly as she does not want them bruised.</p><p>Back in the forest, Hippolyta is surprised on Menalippe’s whereabouts as she knows that the Oracle and Penelope are devoted to each other. Why is she not at her friend’s side? Hippolyta then instructs Philippus to send a messenger to check on Penelope’s condition. An Amazon called Niobe goes to the Temple of Healing to check on her, and one of the healers replies that it is strange that she is in such a deep sleep. Suddenly, Penelope sits up asking where Menalippe is. The surprised Amazons reply that she is helping up setting up the feast. Penelope climbs out of bed, asking why they have been letting her sleep when there is work to be done, but one of the healers grabs her arm and tells her that Epione, another healer, will not allow Penelope to go unless she sees fit. Niobe tells Penelope that she has been sick. Penelope then stares deeply into Niobe’s eyes and asks her if she looks sick. Niobe, transfixed, suddenly agrees that she has recovered. Penelope then tells them that they must not be late.</p><p>In the forest, the Amazons see a glowing orb in the sky and it comes down. The Amazons see Wonder Woman guiding the sphere with her lasso and as it touches down, it disappears and out comes the twelve delegates. The delegates are so surprised by the new environment and Queen Hippolyta steps forward with other Amazons, saluting and welcoming their new guests. Hippolyta then summons a chariot so Henri Claude Tibet can be carried into the city. Lois Lane finds this strange, as this is a race of perfect humans, secluded from the world for 3000 years seems fascinated by physical liabilities. Wonder Woman tells the delegates that it’s ten kilometres to the city and they make their way through the forest.</p><p>When the delegates finally make their way to the streets of Themyscira, they are met by many Amazons. Each of the delegates marvels at the sights surrounding them. Lois Lane goes crazy with the camera, taking almost everything in. High on a balcony, Menalippe, Penelope and Niobe watch and listen down below. Menalippe asks Penelope if she has recovered. She replies that “recovered” is not the right word. Menalippe asks what Penelope sees. She replies that she sees what exactly what Hippolyta and Diana want them to see… the Dawn of a New Age.</p><p>Elsewhere in an unknown location, their words come from a glowing apple held by Eris, the daughter of Ares. She has watched everything and realises that everything is going well according to her plan. She watches the unsuspecting image of Diana, Hippolyta and their guests.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Darkseid cameo flashback appearance.</li><li>On page 8 panel 3 Superman's ""S"" was

of Themyscira, while Eris, Ares' daughter, lays a trap for the Amazon Princess.</em></p><p>Ares' daughter, Eris, is causing trouble for the Amazons.</p><p>The delegates are at an amphitheatre and watch a play about the origins of the Amazons. Amazons emerge from the centre of the arena, re-creating the time when the Goddesses created the Amazons. The play continues, showing how Hippolyta and Antiope were chosen as queens and given the Girdles. Together, they partnered with men and were taken over. Gaea renewed her spirit and called the Amazons to arms. They fought and once the war was over, Hippolyta wanted a peaceful existence while Antiope had bid farewell. Hippolyta led her group to a new island towards the Aegean Sea and Poseidon answered their prayers and parted the sea for them. It was a difficult journey as they feared the water would crash upon them. They finally reached the soils of Paradise Island and every Amazon had the gift of immortality. They then set a new task of building their new home, called Themyscira.</p><p>Menalippe comes to her conclusion of the play and Diana wonders why the oracle sounds so bored in her delivery. Even Lois Lane finds it strange and notices that Diana is embarrassed by such a delivery. As the play ends, Eris watches the events from her magical apple. After the play, Lois makes entries in her journal, describing how the Amazons are finalizing their preparations for the banquet. An Amazon named Clio points out the Golden Apples, neatly set out. Penelope points out that Menalippe should be thanked for that. Just before the banquet, the delegates are invited to mingling. Diana guides them. Felix Zumac wonders about the Garden of Eden and Maritza Nitumbe comments on the richness of the soil. Elsewhere in the library, Phyllis Haller, Alan Witherspoon, Robert Cantwell and Lois Lane are shown by Mnemosyne and the books that are available to read. Cantwell wonders about inbreeding and Phyllis Haller interjects, telling Mnemosyne to ignore him as they are just typical men. Lois continues writing in her journal, explaining what Amazons do when they need medical attention. She writes in her book about a small islet where healing is performed, and Dr. Vladimir Morakov is studying herbology in exchange for modern medical knowledge.</p><p>Back in the capital city, Asmund Lindel comments on the Chaos Wall around the island and asks whether Hippolyta has heard of the Iron Curtain or not, because the Chaos Wall resembles the Iron Curtain. Hippolyta replies that she doesn’t rule with terror. Lindel suggests that they remove it before Hippolyta makes her visit to New York. Hippolyta responds that the Chaos Wall is needed for defense and can be removed by the Gods if necessary.</p><p>Elsewhere, Henri Claude Tibet is being wheeled by an Amazon named Timandra, and Tibet asks about the architecture. Timandra replies that even thought she is an architect, her expertise is in the design of buildings. Themyscira’s city planner died defending Doom’s Doorway.</p><p>At the site of Doom’s Doorway, Hellene and Lin Koo Teng survey the statue commemorating those who died defending the doorway. Lin Koo Teng tells of a similar story, where her friends died defending Tiananmen Square and Hellene tells her that she shouldn’t be so bitter; it will drag her down and that she should forgive. Menalippe appears and points out that without death, there is no life. Hellene and Teng continue the tour and Menalippe says she will catch up with them as she looks up at the statue.</p><p>In the city, Diana, Lois and other few Amazons watch Rovo Quashi play the lyre and is asked if he has ever played it before. Quashi replies that he hasn’t. Diana and Lois leave the Amazons and Quashi and Lois takes this opportunity to interview Diana. The both of them talk about her views on peace, despite her baser aspects of human nature. They also talk about Myndi Mayer and her friendship with Julia and Vanessa Kapatelis. And finally, Superman. Lois had expected Diana to choke at the question, though Diana had smiled and asked her about Superman. Rabbi Hecht is then seen running out of the temple and rants about the Amazon’s beliefs regarding religion. Diana is furious at the thought of an outsider disrespecting their religion. Penelope explains to Diana that they do not want outsiders tainting their faith with other religions. Diana asks the rabbi to calm down, but only if Penelope apologises, however, it is unsuccessful. Lois then sees the opportunity for a big story. She now knows that the illusion of peace <em>is</em> in fact an illusion and if she could communicate with the outside world to tell people about this, she could, though a part of her is glad that she can’t. Diana then finds Menalippe and flies towards the Doom’s Doorway and down below, Hellene and Lin Koo see Diana fly, suggesting that they follow her. However, Hellene says that the feast will begin soon and will need to go back to the city.</p><p>Diana then reaches Menalippe and calls for her. She then hears a noise and finds that the statute has ripped off. She then hears Menalippe’s cries from a void below and Diana attempts to open the void some more to save her sister. She herself can’t move it open and wonders how Menalippe had done so in the first place. Diana does manage to pull apart the void and calls for Menalippe. The ground below her then disappears and she is kept up by strong winds. She then sees a light and Menalippe’s voice tells her that this is the way to freedom. Diana flies towards it to find a serpent which attacks her. She dodges it, but other heads of the serpent attack her as well. She is grabbed by one and it squeezes her until she cuts the serpent’s throat with her tiara. But the attack on causes an eruption of flames from the wound and her tiara is shot out of Diana’s hand. Twigs then tie around her ankle and wrists and she sees her skin turning into wood. She then sees Menalippe is standing beside Eris, Ares’ daughter. Menalippe tells Diana that their fate is with Ares. Diana turns completely into wood and everything goes black.</p><p>Night begins to show itself and the banquet has almost begun. Hippolyta wonders where her daughter and the oracle are. Of all people, how can it be them that are late? Lois replies that they are just being fashionably late, but Hippolyta replies that Menalippe cannot be late because without her, they cannot begin. Lin Koo tells Hellene that perhaps they should have followed Diana, but Hellene replies that they would’ve been late as well and it would be disrespectful to the guests and her queen. Penelope, in a vicious tone, says that they should begin, so they can go back to where they came from. Philippus reminds her of her rudeness, even to her sisters. She asks if there’s something on her mind. Philippus suggests a search party, but she is cut short when Diana and Menalippe walk into the chamber. They apologise for being late, and take a seat at the table, eyeing the Golden Apples. Lois is confused about their behaviour, remembering their talk earlier. Maybe she’s just hiding her true feelings in front of the guests? But Lois thinks otherwise… Lois knows that Diana has eyes that tell her true feelings, and that her eyes right now tell her nothing. Diana then announces, “Let the Feast of Five begin!”</p>",,,,,,,False,63502,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/49436-3824-63502-1-wonder-woman.jpg',

of the golden apples infiltrates Paradise Island and spreads across the island to all those on it.</em></p><p>Eris' plan are working in perfect order, and Wonder Woman can't possibly help with her own current status; it's up to Lois Lane to save her!</p><p>Hermes is having a vision of Diana where she is floating in a void. He holds Diana and he tries to wake her, because that way, he knows she will be safe. Though she does not wake when he calls her name. Bark then splinters her flesh and she is choking from her own foliage. She then disappears and Hermes realises that he must go after her if she is to reclaim her soul. Hermes cries out her name, surprising Steve Trevor while he is driving. Steve asks Hermes what the problem is and he rips the seatbelt and flies across the field calling for Diana.</p><p>On Paradise Island, Lois listens to Menalippe who performs the opening ritual but something does not stick with her. Lois stares at Diana who stares back rather coldly. Menalippe finishes speaking but before they can actually begin the feast, Diana stands up and starts addressing the crowd. Diana thanks Menalippe for addressing the crowd and asks everyone to eat the Golden Apples that are placed in front of them. Rovo Quashi is suspicious and tells Lois not to eat them and realises that she is not the only one who is suspicious. Lois and Quashi refuse to eat theirs and Diana asks why. Lois says that she is on a diet.</p><p>Back in Man’s World, Hermes is upset about Diana and her soul. Steve walks over and tells Hermes that they need to get to Hackensack by 3pm and asks Hermes to get back into the car. But Hermes refuses saying that her soul is no longer in the mortal plane. Steve asks if she is dead, but Hermes replies that her soul is elsewhere and closes his eyes to search for her again.</p><p>On Themyscira, everyone is having fun at the banquet, but Rabbi Hecht throws his meat onto the plate, claiming that it isn’t kosher. One of the Amazons convince him that the meat is done as he likes, but he calls her a liar. He accuses her of poisoning him. Vladimir Morakov tells him to calm down and enjoy it while he can as women are the only thing in which women are good for. The rabbi challenges him to a fight while Phyllis Haller tells him that his comment was inappropriate. Hellene agrees and suggests that the Amazons take over Man’s World. Reverend Alan decides to join in and says this is what happens when natural order isn’t followed. Mnemosyne asks whose natural order it is exactly. Robert Cantwell then joins in and takes the side of the Amazons and believes that the Reverend is disrespecting the Amazon’s beliefs. Henri Claude Tibet interrupts and warns the Reverend to keep his hand off Mnemosyne or else she would sleep with a strange man. The Amazons the accuse him of thinking only about sex. Maritza Nitumbe then accuses Philippe of following a white queen and not standing up for her rights as a coloured person. Cantwell comes in again and Marizta tells him to be quiet. Felix Zumac then accuses them of believing he is responsible just because he is Haitian. Asmund Lindel then stands up and orders everyone to be quiet. Diana stands up and tells him that he has no right to order them around and that the only reason why they are here is because she deemed it okay. Hippolyta joins in as well and reminds her daughter that she is queen.</p><p>Lois realises what’s going on and realises that this story would get her into journalism-stardom. She brings out her camera, though Lin Koo Teng grabs it off her, accusing her of being an American journalist and smashes it on the ground. Rovo Quashi tells her to calm down, saying that Lois couldn’t help because she wasn’t in Tiananmen Square. Lin Koo snaps back, saying that he could never feel what it’s like when close friends die. Robert Cantwell then grabs Lin Koo and a fight breaks out between everyone. Cantwell suggests that they get out of here and drags Lin Koo with him. Lois grabs Rovo with her and Diana spots them sneaking out, with a cold face.</p><p>In the void, Wonder Woman’s soul is floating around and is watching these arguments and fights and struggles to break free as she wishes to fix the problem. She then falls back into unconsciousness. Steve asks why Hermes cannot connect with Diana and he replies that her hope is cut off from her soul. Without this hope, there is only confusion and despair.</p><p>Back on Themyscira, the people fight goes out onto the streets of Themyscira and Lois and the other three who escaped run down an alleyway, straight in Diana. Diana asks Lois if she’s in a hurry to bring in her story and starts mocking her by suggesting some headlines for her story. Diana then says, “This Great Mission of mine. It was all a farce. An act. Designed to prove what miserable people we all really are!” Lois replies that she is the only miserable person on this island but Rovo points out that this isn’t the real Wonder Woman and points out the way Wonder Woman is acting right now, as she would never do so if she were her real self. Lois demands to know where the real Wonder Woman is. Diana then asks Lin Koo what she thinks and she replies that she has learned that leaders cannot be trusted. Diana is offended by such comment and lunges for her and Lin Koo runs from her. Diana looks for Lin Koo, and Lois sneaks up on Diana and throws a rock over her head. Diana then grabs Lois by throat, throwing her away. As Lois goes into unconsciousness, she then sees the real Wonder Woman in her vision and she is struggling, as if she is fighting something. All of a sudden, the fake Diana melts into a puddle and Eris watches these events in anger.</p><p>Rovo comments on the puddle which smells like the apples that were at the banquet. Lois asks Cantwell if he ate an apple and Cantwell says he didn’t as he is allergic to apples, and Lin Koo at one. Lois points out that the apples may have been tainted. Lin Koo tells her that does not feel any different from what she usually is. Lois tells her to listen to herself, as she can hear the hatred in her voice. Lin Koo doesn’t listen, though, and believes they are following the typical stereotype of a Chinese girl, that they are quiet and polite. Lois adds that between the Rabbi and some other Amazons, an argument had broken out and that she saw apples in the temple too. She also notes that Menalippe had brought the apples in and that Diana was looking for Menalippe. On the street, they hi-jack some horses and make their escape but Philippus spots them. Menalippe orders the Amazons to arrest them and kill them if necessary. The four gallop through the woods and taking several turns to lose their pursuers, they end up in front of the statue at Doom’s Doorway. They see the cave opening Wonder Woman had fell in to and Lin Koo tells them that that had been fully blocked.</p><p>Cantwell grabs a torch and tells them that he is going to investigate. They make their way slowly inside and it’s very dark, even with the torch. Rovo hears Wonder Woman’s voice. They follow the voice and Lois begins feeling Wonder Woman’s presence. She pushes the other people aside, determined to find Wonder Woman. Rovo yells a warning, but it is too late as Lois falls through a hole. She grabs a root with one hand and secures a tighter hold for herself. She then sees something in the darkness; it’s Eris standing on a rock beside a tree – and embedded in the tree is Wonder Woman who has been turned into wood.</p>",,,,,,,False,63503,"{'icon_url':

Meanwhile, Eris who watching all the chaos unfold throws an apple down into the void and an explosion of white light opens up a portal which shows what’s happening on Themyscira – Amazons fighting each other. Lois tells Eris that this will end and the Amazons will do so as well.

Cantwell then realises that Eris is connected with the Golden Apples and apologises for not spotting this earlier. She tells them not to blame themselves, as she had even fooled the Goddesses, leading to the war in Troy. Now the Amazons are doing the same thing by destroying themselves, as the fruit hides all the barriers of hate. Eris continues to explain how the reporters will now report back to Man’s World with stories of failure and disappointment. Lin Koo races up, yelling that she realises that she is “Wang Mu”, the creator of disease and death. She then slips and is holding onto Cantwell, crying tears of fear.

She telepathically tells him that he should get back to the city. She tells him to listen to her voice and get out of here. He gets onto a horse and the horse makes its way back to the city.</p><p>Eris manages to catch the boy escaping and says that whoever wishes to aid Diana will be killed. Meanwhile, Lois has helped Lin Koo regain her balance and she overhears Eris muttering Rovo’s name. Eris summons an image of Menalippe, as if controlling her actions. Cantwell knows that something is about happen involving Rovo and decides to throw an apple towards Eris. It knocks out the apple that Eris is holding. Eris turns to him and tells him that he is sorry for doing so. The Tree of Discord comes to life and feeds on the people’s blood and draining their life force. Lin Koo screams for Wonder Woman to help them out. Wonder Woman hears Lin Koo and replies weakly that she will help them. She then sees a vision in the distance. It is Hermes, telling her that she can nothing here, and that she should focus her energy on Rovo, as he is their only hope.</p><p>In the city, Rovo rides through the city as the fighting continues on. Menalippe spots him and raises a spear to throw at him, though Hellene stops her and tells her that they will not harm the helpless. Penelope then knocks Hellene out. Rovo makes it to safety and the two Amazons run after him. Hippolyta is watching all this and sees Hellene unconscious and questions what they are doing.</p><p>Inside, Menalippe and Penelope look for Rovo. They go inside a room to kill the boy, when they find an ghost-like version of Hermes, telling them to not kill mortals. If they ever will, they will be sorry for doing so. He tells them to wake up and realise what they are doing. They must stop what they are doing or else he will finish off the job for them. The Amazons run out as Hermes falls to the ground, as his energy used to disguise Rovo has sucked the life out of him. Rovo is revealed to be holding Wonder Woman’s costume. Rovo communicates with Diana, asking what he should do next. Diana tells him to find her mother and tell her to go to Doom’s Doorway. Hippolyta and a few other Amazons find Rovo. She asks Rovo where her daughter is, while Diana pleads for Hermes to make them understand. She questions why her god would leave her in her most desperate hour of need.</p><p>Back in America, Hermes collapses, Steve realises that Hermes needs a good earned rest.</p><p>On Themyscira, something is happening to the three as Wonder Woman who is integrated in to the tree starts blinking, as if she is alive again. Eris looks through the portal and sees Themyscira opening its eyes and she sees the Amazons drop their weapons. Many of the people who were fighting realise what they were doing. Timandra realised she had knocked down Henri Claude Tibet, and helps him back up again. Alan Witherspoon drops his weapons as well and Menalippe sees what happens and says that the Amazons cannot stand for this. Other delegates join in and agree with Menalippe.</p><p>Eris, watching through the portal, cries out in anger as she realises that her plan has been foiled. Eris turns to Wonder Woman and tells her that this isn’t over. However, Wonder Woman’s hand move and the four delegates with her cheer encouragement while Eris yells in frustration. The tree explodes and Diana sets herself free from the tree and makes her way in front of Eris. She flies towards her friends and helps them, ripping away the branches holding Cantwell, Lois and Lin Koo. Eris tells them that the apple feeds the animal within them that creates hate in everyone, including Wonder Woman! But Diana replies that for every beast, there is a lamb. The apple that Eris was holding bursts into flames and screams of pain. Wonder Woman carries the four back to safety and Lois asks what Wonder Woman had done to that apple. Wonder Woman says she did nothing. Cantwell explains that without hate, the apples can do nothing and Diana tells them to let go of their anger as that is the only way home.</p><p>She leaves the four on the ledge to safety and Wonder Woman flies back to Eris, who fires her own energy blast at Wonder Woman. She blocks them in time to block to attack but she gets thrown back into a wall. Wonder Woman keeps defending Eris’ energy blasts while Lois watches on. Wonder Woman is holding them back and she wonders how she can fight back without anymore destruction. She calls Athena for help. Eris tells Wonder Woman that her gods can do nothing for her. Eris thinks to finish the fight off with a blast to Wonder Woman’s head. Just in time, she blocks it. Then, Eris is surrounded by the Amazons. Hippolyta carries a bow and an arrow which hangs around Wonder Woman’s lasso. Hippolyta fires the bow into the tree trunk, as Wonder Woman grabs the lasso. She wraps it around the tree, as the Tree of Discord cannot stand the heat of the truth of the lasso, and the tree bursts into flames. Eris throws herself into the void below and Diana dives down, wondering what is going on with the goddess. Eris shouts back that she has a different path to hers and says goodbye to Diana, adding that she is definitely something different, one for the Olympians. A huge explosion happens, signifying her disappearance. The explosion however makes the chamber unstable. Hippolyta calls out that Diana has been killed, but Diana makes it out of the rocks buried on top of her and Hippolyta reaches for her hand and pulls her out. When all is well, Lois tells Diana that she beat Eris, but Diana replies that they all beat Eris. All the Amazons and delegates feel a sense of a well-deserved victory as they come together and this is what perhaps drives humanity. That there is a promise, a promise of peace.</p>",,,,,,,False,63504,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/49438-3824-63504-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url':

The mail arrives from a jeep and Julia looks through the pile for Vanessa’s mail. She sits down to read it. Reading it, Vanessa says that she is having fun so far and has a crush on a boy called Dennis Dunn and wishes she had a real bra like her friend Lucy. Vanessa has to stay with nine and ten year old kids and a senior counselor and are to say the Pledge of Alliance which she finds annoying, seeing as this is meant to be a camp of fun and not school.</p><p>Curtis steps out of the tent for coffee and Marty follows him, asking how long they are going to stay here for, as it has been two months and nothing has come up. Curtis steps back inside the tent and Julia asks him if Marty is thinking of quitting. He then asks Julia if that is Vanessa’s letter and she nods and adds that she hopes she has made the right decision by allowing her to go to Summer Camp. She adds that she has a strange feeling. Curtis asks for the newspaper on Julia’s bed and asks if he can read it as she continues to read Vanessa’s letter. Vanessa had been on a nature hike and took a swim in the lake. She noticed that Lucy had a real bust and she looked like nothing next to her and knows that Dennis likes Lucy too. She adds that Lucy is so lucky, having her period as well. She asks her mother when she had her period. “Fourteen,” Julia shouts out. She then asks Curtis what news he is reading, and says it’s about Wonder Woman. He goes to read the first paragraph:</p><p><i>Amidst the rubble of fear and bigotry left in the dust of Eris' departure, Queen Hippolyta and her Amazons re-dedicated themselves to the spirit of fidelity and sisterhood that was the basis for their Feast of Five and this Themysciran Summit. Princess Diana, known to the outside world as Wonder Woman, spoke of her Gods and their dreams of fulfillment through humanity's common destiny. </i></p><p>Somewhat shamefacedly Amazons and delegates had returned to the city to clean up the aftermath of the recent brawls. Of all the Amazons, Menalippe suffered the most. She felt her complicity with Eris had disavowed her sacred trust with the Goddesses. Everyone, including the delegates, worked to persuade her that any one of them could have fallen and indeed had fallen to the tainted sweetness of the Golden Apples. But according to the article's author, Lois Lane, it will be a long time before the Amazon oracle can face her Delphi again.</p><p>Soon the disparate cultures stood and faced each other for a final time. For a little while they had come together but would it last? Queen Hippolyta spoke all the right words - about harmony and understanding, optimism and hope. She promised to come to the United Nations soon. But it is so hard to make plans with immortals as their time frame is so different from the rest of the world.</p><p>Asmund Lindel promised the queen would be made welcome whenever she comes. Then amidst tears and hugs, the Themysciran Summit ended. With the goodbyes done, Wonder Woman told them it was time to go and like a biblical angel, she had lifted into the air, looping her golden lasso around the waiting delegates. A shimmer of light enveloped them all and they faded from view, returning across Chaos and back to Patriarch's World.</p><p>Julia continues to read her daughter’s letter: Vanessa tells of campfire for dinner and they told and listened to stories and Lucy asked if Vanessa could tell her story about Diana. Vanessa was uneasy about this, as she wanted people to know her for her, not who she knows, but then again, Lucy was never the one to be jealous. Also, Dennis was there so she may as well tell her story. She told the story of how she dived off a cliff from Paradise Island and tries to be honest just like Diana, but finds it difficult. Sometimes she looks in the mirror and hates herself, but realises everyone has their own time to develop, as unfair as that is. Vanessa and Lucy then had a walk and Lucy said that having breasts is no big deal. Vanessa asks if there is something wrong with her, and Lucy reassures her that nothing is. She continues to write how Lucy is perhaps the luckiest girl in the world, being able to travel to Europe and told Lucy about it. Lucy replies that Vanessa is the lucky one, as her parents don’t treat her like a child and adds that because of that, Vanessa understands life better than her. Vanessa knows she’s saying something of importance here but doesn’t understand.</p><p>Outside, the archaeologists see something fall into one of their digging spots and pick up a pigeon with something wrapped around its neck and let Julia know. Back in the tent, Julia continues reading about Vanessa’s experience at camp: Vanessa ran into the changing rooms all excited and yelled to Lucy, “I got it!” Lucy smiled and knew what Vanessa got: her period. Vanessa apologises in the letter to her mother about being immature and now she knows better and promises not to be like that in the future. She tells her mother that she loves her. Curtis then comes in and sees that she is crying from the letter. He offers to leave the tent for some alone time, but Julia shakes her head and Curtis continues, saying that they have found a tired bird. Julia recognises it and reads Diana’s message.</p><p>She reads: Diana says that she had accomplished this journey, and but felt she was rude that she just dropped off and left the delegates at the United Nations, but all she could think about was Julia, Vanessa and home. She sometimes wonders what it’s like just living as a “woman”. She wonders what it would be like if she could just be normal like Julia and Vanessa. But she doesn’t mean “normal” as unimportant, but rather doing everyday things like Vanessa “studying” when she is really talking to her friend on the phone, and it shames Diana to say that this life makes her jealous. But Julia and Vanessa have loved Diana for herself. She continues to say that she was disappointed when she found Julia had her archeological dig with Vanessa being on camp. She also looked for Hermes and thanked him for helping her through the situation with Eris. But now, he is not omnipotent and is a mortal, though some humanity should do him good. However, Hermes doesn’t deserve pity. Even though he is sometimes arrogant, he does what’s best for humanity. He had given her the Caduceus when in fact he needed it to save his fading power. She continues, saying that she couldn’t contact anymore, so she went to Steve Trevor’s apartment. The land lord had given her some verbal abuse about Steve sending a woman to do his bidding. Diana flew off and was frustrated and thought of returning to Themyscira, but she doesn’t want to run home everytime she feels down and wonders if she could join Julia on the dig. She doesn’t want to be a nuisance, but Etta Candy is away on an assignment, and Superman is busy. The people at Meyer Agency didn’t seem to have time for Wonder Woman. She adds that she misses Julia and would like to join; is that possible? Julia asks Curtis if that’s okay and he says that they can use some extra help. Julia writes a “Yes” and sends the messenger on its way. Julia asks if the bird is sick, as it looks like it has fear in its eyes but the others suggest that it’s tired. They let the bird fly and it struggles for a while but makes flight.</p><p>In Beacon Hill, Diana is reading a book recommended by Vanessa and wonders what Julia’s reply will be.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bird making its way back to Diana looks startled, as something flies right above it. A huge winged figure makes the bird fall…</p>",,,,,,,False,63505,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/49439-3824-63505-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url':

In a nearby building, Henry Armbruster and Mister Choi watch Silver Swan and monitor her readings. Silver Swan then releases her sonic cry and hits Wonder Woman straight on. A helicopter then arrives with Armbruster and Choi as its passengers and a technician shows the head of an android Wonder Woman but Armbruster thinks otherwise. Silver Swan approaches him and smiles, but Armbruster pushes her away. She says that she destroyed the body, and isn’t that good enough? Armbruster, angry at the result, punches her and yells, “What do I want from you? What do I want?” He then tells her to go home, and she flies off. Mr. Choi tells Armbruster that he should give her encouraging words every now and then, and reminds him that she has changed. Armbruster then asks about Professor Buchman’s stolen files, and Mr. Choi replies that they are closing in on them.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Julia Kapatelis’ house, Diana speaks with Steve on the phone. She asks how Etta is and Steve replies that she is fine. However, Diana detects something in his voice and tells him that she is lying. She asks if there’s anything wrong with the engagement, and Steve replies that there isn’t, so far. She pushes him but he prefers not to talk about it, and Diana says that she is always there for him. He then says that the event at Themyscira sounds like it was pretty crazy. She agrees and asks if Hermes is there. Steve says that he is, and that he wanted the both of them to come to the bar together, though now Hermes is off with some ladies. Just then, a redneck comes out and says that Hermes is dealing with his lady. Steve wraps up the phone call, and catches a punch that the redneck threw and throws him to the floor. Suddenly, Steve finds himself surrounded by many men, and Hermes tells the ladies that Steve is trained, from the military, so he is able to handle himself. But Steve finds that the numbers are becoming overwhelming and finds himself held back by two men while another throws a punch. But just before that fist can hit Steve, Hermes grabs the fist and breaks the wrist. With his blistering speed, he takes down the other men and Steve tells him to stop showing off. Hermes gives the bartender some money for the damage and takes the beaten Steve outside.</p><p>At another Kapatelis residence, the police are interviewing a neighbour, Mrs. Gloria Sullivan, who was keeping an eye on the house for Julia. Her husband had found her tied to a chair and called the police. Gloria explains that there had been two intruders, and one of them was a woman. The officer in charger tells the other officer to call for Inspector Indelicato as Wonder Woman is sometimes seen at this house.</p><p>Back at the Kapatelis residence, where Diana is staying, she sleeps in her bed. Her hearing then hears a series of footsteps outside the house. She changes into her costume and flies up in the sky, scanning for the intruder and then hears the sounds of gunfire and a man screaming. She zooms into the location and finds several ninjas. She asks them what they have done and they only return in gunfire. She deflects them with her bracelets and tells them that she does not want to fight, but they do not listen and she has no choice but to bowl them over with her strength. The ninjas then bring out their knives, but it’s no use against Wonder Woman. She asks if they are ready to talk yet, but one ninja opens fire once again and she replies with a hit against him. One of the ninjas slip away and manage to fire darts towards the injured man, but Wonder Woman, with her lightning reactions and beats the darts and manages to block them off. The other ninjas use their martial arts, but she outclasses them in every way, and finally, uses her lasso to round them all up and looks towards the injured man. She introduces herself and he says that he is Solomon Buchman. He tells her that the ninjas must not get to the files. She replies, saying she does not know what he is talking about, but she realises this name and remembers that he has heard it before. She asks him if she has ever heard of the Silver Swan. Just then, another gunshot can be heard from the house, and Wonder Woman races back to the house and finds another ninja who she stops, and a woman who says that Diana must take this to help Val, before she kills them all. Diana asks who this “Val” is, but before the lady can answer, she is interrupted by some more gunfire and flies back to Buchman as he fires his gun into the air. Diana then realises that the woman who was in Julia’s house was Maxine Sterenbuch, Valerie’s friend. Wonder Woman then hears the sonic cry and realises that it’s Silver Swan’s calling card. Before Wonder Woman can go after the Silver Swan though, the cry hits her and she falls to the ground. Maxine runs to where Wonder Woman fell and helps her to her feet. The both of them stare in awe at the spot in which the ninjas and Buchman lay, which has replaced them with an empty crater and Wonder Woman’s lasso.</p><p>However, Silver Swan has grabbed Solomon by the neck and Maxine tells her to stop this madness. Valerie is not the person she is now as she was always caring and loving, but now she has turned into this. Maxine doesn’t understand as she was always as good as anyone else but no one would believe what they said, until Armbruster turned up. Silver Swan replies quite harshly, telling her shut up and that Maxine is just wrong, that he had been right about her all along. Maxine had used Valerie and she will never forget that. Maxine replies that that’s not true and Valerie asks why she is standing with Wonder Woman, and Maxine replies that she feels safer with her. Valerie then tells her friend that she would never hurt her and that she was only trying to take the bag from her. Maxine holds out the bag for Valerie and tells her that she will prove that she is still her friend. With this distraction, Wonder Woman makes for her lasso and the Silver Swan then realises that she isn’t there. She tells Maxine that she lied to cover up Wonder Woman. At the same time, Wonder Woman is speeding towards Silver Swan. Silver Swan opens her mouth, as Wonder Woman flies towards her, with a explosion in the entire area.</p>",,,,,,,False,63506,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/49440-3824-63506-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",42,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/massachusetts/4020-55745/'}]",The Silver Wing of Terror,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41435/', 'id': 41435, 'name': 'Lasso of Truth', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51517/', 'id': 51517, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Bracelets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-bracelets/4055-51517/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56852/', 'id': 56852, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Earrings"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-earrings/4055-56852/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51489/', 'id': 51489, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Tiara"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14688/', 'id': 14688, 'name': 'Chris Marrinan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/chris-marrinan/4040-14688/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2913/', 'id': 2913, 'name': 'George Pérez', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/george-perez/4040-2913/', 'role': 'writer, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43437/', 'id': 43437, 'name': 'Karen Berger', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/karen-berger/4040-43437/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48669/', 'id': 48669, 'name': 'Mindy Newell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mindy-newell/4040-48669/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14639/', 'id': 14639, 'name': 'Romeo Tanghal', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/romeo-tanghal/4040-14639/', 'role': 'inker'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman-42-the-silver-wing-of-terror/4000-63506/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-61594/', 'id': 61594, 'name': 'Boston Police Department', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston-police-department/4060-61594/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-3824/', 'id': 3824, 'name': 'Wonder Woman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman/4050-3824/'}"

And it doesn't go so well.</p><p>Silver Swan releases her sonic cry while still tied up in Wonder Woman’s lasso. Maxine, Solomon and Wonder Woman crouch behind a rock while Silver Swan destroys the area around her. The screaming finally stops, and Wonder Woman pokes her head out to see where the Silver Swan is. She sees something like a deformity and Silver Swan cries out for Armbruster not to abandon her. She then flies off, taking Wonder Woman with her.</p><p>Elsewhere, some technicians are telling Mr. Choi that they have lost contact with the Silver Swan. The technicians tell him it will take half an hour to re-connect with her. Mr. Choi informs Armbruster of the problem and annoyingly tells them to quickly fix it. He then looks at a photo of Valerie and throws it against the wall.</p><p>Back with Silver Swan, continues flying, taking Wonder Woman with her. Diana reasons with her, but Silver Swan tells her if she doesn’t let go, she’ll kill them both. Silver Swan begins to get into a frenzy again, and Wonder Woman counters this with a flick from her lasso and throws the Silver Swan into the lake below. Maxine rushes to the lake and yells to Wonder Woman that Valerie can’t swim. Wonder Woman flies down and lifts her out of the water. Maxine asks why she had to be so rough on her, and Wonder Woman replies that she had no choice. Diana explains that Valerie isn’t hurt, but Solomon and Maxine are. Maxine pleads not to get the doctors involved, especially the police because the both of them broke in Julia’s house to find Diana. Also, the police will treat Valerie like a monster if they get a hold of her. Maxine continues to explain that this is all Hank Armbruster’s fault. He was the one that turned her into this. Maxine and Solomon had been trying to get Valerie out of his clutch, and that’s why the ninjas came and attacked him. Wonder Woman, confused explains that it felt as if Valerie didn’t want their help, though Diana had felt her pain when she grabbed hold of the lasso. Maxine explains that that was Valerie’s true self. She continues to explain that Armbruster uses Wonder Woman as someone Valerie could never live up to. Maxine says that with Diana’s lasso, they can now get inside her mind and help her out.</p><p>Wonder Woman is still confused though, and asks why Solomon had attempted to shoot Silver Swan and why would he want to help her now? Maxine pulls out some records Solomon’s father had been keeping. Armbruster had taken them and they stole it. So that’s why Armbruster wants them dead. They then hear helicopters coming towards them and Maxine says that it’s Armbruster’s men. The lead pilot radios his boss, saying that he can see three survivors. Armbruster orders him to kill everyone there, even Valarie, as long as they get the records back. Down below, they hear the helicopter warning them to release the Silver Swan and too give back the records. Wonder Woman questions them by asking who they are and demands that they identify themselves first. Meanwhile, Maxine is pleading with Valerie, asking her to help them out. Valerie replies that she can’t, or Armbruster will kill her. Valerie is still confused and wonders why her lover would want to kill her. Maxine reminds her of the things that Armbruster has done for her: nothing. Valerie stands up and cannot stand for her friend getting hurt. Valerie asks Maxine for the files. Wonder Woman tells Maxine that Valerie had the lasso around her so she is telling the truth.</p><p>Silver Swan flies up towards the helicopter and tells the lead helicopter to stop what they’re doing, in the name of Hank Armbruster. The pilot asks Armbruster if they need new orders, and Armbruster orders his men to stand by. Armbruster then seeks advice from Mr. Choi, and Mr. Choi tells him that Armbruster should’ve allowed her to visit Maxine. He then tells her to reason with her as Valerie seems as she is still on the side of her mentor and lover. Armbruster talks with Valerie and tells her to go home. She asks why she can’t talk with her friend and Armbruster orders her to come home with a scowl. He then orders his men to open fire on her. The helicopters then open fire on Silver Swan, and Wonder Woman flies up and blocks the bullets with her bracelets. Silver Swan pushes Wonder Woman out of the way and uses her sonic scream, destroying the cockpit of the helicopters. The helicopters ask if they can retreat, but Armbruster orders them to keep firing. With that, Silver Swan increases the intensity of her scream and begins to destroy the helicopters’ weapons. Silver Swan loses her breath and stops screaming. Exhausted, she falls from the sky and Wonder Woman flies to catch her as the helicopters fly back to base. Armbruster angrily questions Mr. Choi on how both Wonder Woman and Silver Swan can still be alive. Mr. Choi retaliates, saying that it should not be blamed on him. He was not the one who pushed her so hard. However, Armbruster has a smug look on his face. She will return to him – it’s just a matter of time.</p><p>On Paradise Island, an Amazon called Ismure enters the healing room as Epione heals Solomon. Hippolyta and Euboea watch the treatment and Euboea asks why this man is here. Hippolyta replies that Diana had brought him here and gave an Amazon’s promise that this man would completely heal and recover to Maxine. Euboea asks Hippolyta why they would bring him here if they are just bullet wounds. Surely Man’s World has dealt with bullet wounds before. Hippolyta wonders that too, though she is certain her daughter would’ve taken this man to a Man’s World hospital, so there must be a reason why he is brought here.</p><p>At Massachusetts, Diana thanks Etta Candy for taking care of Maxine and Valerie. However, something is troubling Etta and she feels that around Diana’s presence. Maybe it’s because Diana’s so beautiful, or maybe because they would’ve gotten married by now. Wonder Woman explains that they are nothing more than friends and that Steve loves Etta very much. Etta replies that it’s not a matter of love, but of time. She loves her job, but together with the Hermes, being around Steve could be a problem. Wonder Woman now realises how Etta feels and that she and the others will leave if she wants. Etta feels that that’s not necessary, as she has the video set up for them. Maxine and Valerie then come out of a room, with Maxine comforting Valerie, as they prepare to watch the video from Buchman’s laboratory. As the tape begins to play, they see the Silver Swan release one of her sonic screams to Professor Benjamin Bunchman, Solomon’s father. Maxine tells Valerie that she does not have to watch the video if she wants, but Valerie says that she wants to. Valerie explains that she was defending her and Armbruster, who Buchman was trying to kill.</p><p>The others do not believe her however and snarls, but Maxine asks her to tell her story from the beginning. Valerie says that she was ugly and unloved, until Armbruster appeared. He did not care for her looks. Though Valerie knew that he would lose money because of her, as he was a rich businessman. Armbruster offered his help, and had found Ben Buchman and given him money to make Valerie happy. Buchman had developed a special liquid and Valerie was dipped in it. When it was finished, Valerie was revealed in front of a mirror, and she was so happy with the result – she was beautiful. Valerie begins to cry as she realises that she has turned her back on the man that helped her out when nobody would. Diana reminds her that Armbruster had tried to kill her some hours ago. Valerie snaps back, saying that Diana knows nothing about men, especially coming from a woman who came from a female society. Diana replies that she knows enough about men that they wouldn’t hurt the woman they love. Valerie replies that she is wrong. Armbruster had in fact protected her from Buchman. Buchman wanted to experiment on her some more but she didn’t want to. Armbruster assured her that it was alright, so she climbed back in the tank. She then heard Buchman and Armbruster arguing, and then there had been a flash of light, and she woke up to find herself floating while the tank had exploded. She then saw Buchman was a monkey wrench in her hand, and Armbruster on the floor. It was obvious that Buchman was trying to kill Armbruster. She then had this urge to release something from her stomach. She kept building it up, and then released a sonic scream that destroyed the whole laboratory. Armbruster then taught her how to use her scream so no one else would hurt her.</p><p>Maxine then asks sarcastically, “Or still ugly, right Val? A fate worse than death.” Maxine then talks about the letters they had sent each other. Maxine does not care what Valerie looks like. How could she believe what Armbruster had said about her? Valerie replies that Armbruster still loves her. If Maxine had really cared, then she wouldn’t be trying to kill her. She brushes if off though, as she says that she will die soon anyway. Wonder Woman asks what that means and Valerie walks out of the room. Maxine suggests that Wonder Woman use her lasso on her, but Wonder Woman says that she shouldn’t as she is emotionally fragile, and that doing so could be very harmful. Etta then calls them to her computer, where she was looking at Buchman’s files. Etta says she looked over Valerie’s body scans, and that she spotted some weird. It seems as if there are differences in the body scans – that there are two Silver Swans! They then hear a noise from the other room and sees Silver Swan fly out the window up to a helicopter. Before she can react, she hears another noise where Etta and Maxine were, and find them being held at gunpoint by Armbruster’s men.</p>",,,,,,,False,63507,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'medium_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'screen_large_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'small_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'super_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'thumb_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'tiny_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'original_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/49441-3824-63507-1-wonder-woman.jpg', 'image_tags': 'All Images'}",43,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56311/', 'id': 56311, 'name': 'Boston', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/boston/4020-56311/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-55745/', 'id': 55745, 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/massachusetts/4020-55745/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/location/4020-56187/', 'id': 56187, 'name': 'Themyscira', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/themyscira/4020-56187/'}]",The Armageddon Aria,"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-41435/', 'id': 41435, 'name': 'Lasso of Truth', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56631/', 'id': 56631, 'name': 'Talaria', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/talaria/4055-56631/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51517/', 'id': 51517, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Bracelets"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-bracelets/4055-51517/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-56852/', 'id': 56852, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Earrings"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-earrings/4055-56852/'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/object/4055-51489/', 'id': 51489, 'name': ""Wonder Woman's Tiara"", 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-womans-tiara/4055-51489/'}]","[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-7825/', 'id': 7825, 'name': 'Carl Gafford', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carl-gafford/4040-7825/', 'role': 'colorist'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14688/', 'id': 14688, 'name': 'Chris Marrinan', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/chris-marrinan/4040-14688/', 'role': 'artist, penciler, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-2913/', 'id': 2913, 'name': 'George Pérez', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/george-perez/4040-2913/', 'role': 'writer, cover'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-9421/', 'id': 9421, 'name': 'John Costanza', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/john-costanza/4040-9421/', 'role': 'letterer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-43437/', 'id': 43437, 'name': 'Karen Berger', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/karen-berger/4040-43437/', 'role': 'editor'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-48669/', 'id': 48669, 'name': 'Mindy Newell', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mindy-newell/4040-48669/', 'role': 'writer'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-14639/', 'id': 14639, 'name': 'Romeo Tanghal', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/romeo-tanghal/4040-14639/', 'role': 'inker'}, {'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/person/4040-42589/', 'id': 42589, 'name': 'Tom Peyer', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tom-peyer/4040-42589/', 'role': 'editor'}]",https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman-43-the-armageddon-aria/4000-63507/,,[],"[{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/team/4060-42494/', 'id': 42494, 'name': 'Amazons of Themyscira', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/'}]",[],"{'api_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-3824/', 'id': 3824, 'name': 'Wonder Woman', 'site_detail_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman/4050-3824/'}"

She demands to know where Maxine and Etta are. Mr. Choi replies, saying that she shouldn’t ask any questions. She tells him that she can simply break free, though Mr. Choi replies that she shouldn’t. Even though she could break free, even with her pain tolerance, doing so will cause Etta and Maxine’s cage to overload, causing them to die a death of being electrocuted. Mr. Choi also mentions her lasso, and what it did to him and how it compelled him to tell the truth. Mr. Choi then goes on to survey the monitors with Maxine, Etta and Wonder Woman on them. Maxine demands to know where Valerie is, and Mr. Choi tells her to be quiet, as she doesn’t know the politics of power. He then turns on a switch which sends a feed of Valerie hugging Armbruster elsewhere in the complex.</p><p>At the laboratory where Valerie and Armbruster are hugging, Valerie apologises for leaving him and Armbruster tells her not to worry over spilt milk. She tells him that if she keeps acting like this, he will eventually leave her. Armbruster tells her that she is weak minded, and will believe anything with a smile, and that’s how Maxine and Wonder Woman used it against her. Wonder Woman watches from her cage and the words that Armbruster is putting into Valerie’s head. He adds that Wonder Woman is just jealous of Valerie. Maxine yells at the video feed, but Etta tells her to calm down. Mr. Choi is like a poker player – there’s a certain time to change them, but for now Etta tells her that they should follow his rules for now. Etta speaks to Mr. Choi about the file she saw about the cat scans and points out that one was titled “Reversion Experiment”. Wonder Woman adds that when she battled Silver Swan, she saw something very ugly. Mr. Choi, with his poker face, doesn’t respond to this. Wonder Woman then asks why the Silver Swan hates her so much. Mr. Choi replies that she is a paragon of a perfect women, and that makes a perfect target for Silver Swan’s insecurities. An added bonus would be the ability to test out Silver Swan’s scream on Wonder Woman because of her durability. Maxine then chirps in, alerting Wonder Woman to Valerie making her way inside a tank, wrapped in bandages. Etta then tells her that this is Diana’s chance to prove what she’s made of. With that, Diana breaks through the cage, electrifying Maxine and Etta.</p><p>The monitors blow from the surge of electricity and Armbruster asks Mr. Choi on what’s happening. Mr. Choi tells Armbruster that Wonder Woman has broken out and that they have underestimated her. The technicians then tell Armbruster that they have to shut down to check for any damage to the equipment. Armbruster then asks his security guards if they have located Wonder Woman, but the security guards reply, saying that perhaps she had been killed in the electrocution. Armbruster then asks the technicians if Valerie has been harmed, and they reply that they can’t be sure because Professor Buchman has never been past this stage of experiments. Valerie’s brain could be damaged. Armbruster tells his technicians to continue, saying that if she dies, then so be it. Through the chamber, Valerie is outraged from hearing so.</p><p>Wonder Woman makes her way to Choi’s office, knocking the gun out of his hand. She grabs Choi with one hand and grabs her taken equipment with her other hand, and demands to know where Maxine and Etta are. Mr. Choi tells her and within a few moments, breaks open the cage with Maxine and Etta in it, still alive. Surprised, she asks how they survived. Etta tells her that they had been standing on a rubber waist trimmer. Wonder Woman carries them to Mr. Choi with the lasso wrapped around him. Maxine, angry, demands to know where Valerie is.</p><p>Back in the experimenting room, the power levels are off the charts as Armbruster demands to know what’s happening. The technicians inform him that Silver Swan is creating the power surges, and Armbruster tells Valerie to calm down or the experiment will be ruined. Suddenly, a massive explosion creates a disruption in the building. The ceiling begins to fall apart and Wonder Woman holds it up. As the dust settles, Armbruster makes a run for it with Silver Swan behind him. Armbruster looks for something to protect himself when Wonder Woman wraps him in her lasso.</p><p>Valerie uses her sonic scream to look for Armbruster when Wonder Woman steps in asking Valerie to stop what she’s doing. Valerie warns Wonder Woman that she will count down to three. When she hits one, Maxine steps in between them, and says that this will stop. No one will get hurt. Silver Swan replies, by saying that she loves the Silver Swan, and not Valerie as nobody does. Mr. Choi then chirps in, saying that Valerie should open her eyes and that she should not feel sorry for herself. Mr. Choi tells Armbruster to tell the truth. Armbruster, surprised, refuses but Mr. Choi says that the only way out of this situation is to tell the truth. There is no other choice anyway. Armbruster then begins to recount the events leading up to this one. Armbruster begins, saying that Valerie didn’t kill Professor Buchman, and that it was an accident. All Armbruster really wanted to do was make money, while Professor Buchman wanted to help Valerie, as the radiation made her ugly, though it gave her gift, and that was reshaping things with her voice. Professor Buchman wanted to help her by rearranging her molecules to fix her voice. However, Armbruster saw this as an opportunity to make money from this technology and maybe even become bigger than Lex Luthor. Professor Buchman was against this and said that Valerie would never agree to this, though Armbruster says that he seduced her and took advantage from there on. Maxine then interrupts asking whether Armbruster really loved Valerie or not. Armbruster replies that he never loved her – how could anyone love someone as ugly as her? Armbruster continues explaining, saying that Buchman was not fond of this idea because of work ethics. Buchman had then discovered Armbruster’s plans to sell this idea to overseas investors and Buchman didn’t want this risk to Valerie’s life. Armbruster and Buchman then got into a fight and then the explosion happened.</p><p>Silver Swan cries out in guilt from the fact that she killed an innocent man. Maxine replies that she didn’t kill Buchman, as Armbruster had said. Armbruster had lied about her killing Buchman. However, Maxine’s letters had almost revealed Armbruster’s plans and it had also surprised him that she teamed up with Solomon Buchman. Even though Silver Swan was powerful, her up against Wonder Woman on their first encounter was an unfair match, with Wonder Woman overpowering Silver Swan easily. Armbruster then decided that she needed a power up, so he put her through the experiment again. She had been powered up successfully, but she had been transformed into something uglier than before. Armbruster himself was shocked, but he played the lover by calming her down with alcohol. Mr. Choi then mentions some mutant type heroes and their powers. Wonder Woman replies in acknowledgement, and that it happened during the Alien Invasion. Armbruster then says that Choi believed there was something wrong with her gene that caused this. Mr. Choi advised Armbruster that this was fixable, and so Armbruster hired the top scientists to revert her back. She was reverted back, but she had lost her strong power. Armbruster decided to experiment on her some more and so she was brought back to the beautiful form of the Silver Swan. Before Armbruster could experiment on Valerie once again for more power, Maxine and Solomon had stepped in. Maxine says that Valerie had been nothing more than a money making scheme. Maxine then asks whether they told her the experiments could kill her. Choi replies that he gladly would’ve, though it was up to Armbruster, and he had not asked Choi to tell Valerie about the danger of the experiments. Valerie then glares at Armbruster who shows his frightened state. She walks towards him when Wonder Woman steps in between them, and reminds her that this is not Valerie. Maxine asks Valerie to come home, and Valerie runs into Maxine’s arms.</p><p>A few days later on Themyscira, Solomon thanks Wonder Woman on the Amazons healing them. Solomon is then told of the events that happened a few days earlier, and Solomon cannot believe this is happening.

Mr. and Mrs. Spears sob together, while Vanessa’s mother, Julia comforts her and Diana wipes her own tears away. It’s unfortunate that someone so young had wanted to take their life away. Lucy’s casket is later carried out and Vanessa says good bye to her friend. Julia watches and asks if Vanessa is too young for this. Diana replies with a question, asking if anyone is too old for this. Julia says that Vanessa had lost a brother when she was younger and never knew him. Julia scorns herself for her dig at Turkey. Diana says that she shouldn’t scorn herself over this. Perhaps it was herself that was selfish, making her own way over to Turkey. Julia says that she puts too much upon herself, and that she is glad that Diana came over to visit her. Julia remembers the day that she received the message about Vanessa. The team at Turkey had found a chalice and asked for Dr. Stavros Christadoulodou’s help because she had told Diana to rest after the evens of the Silver Swan. Then, she received the message.</p><p>Julia comes back to present time where she’s driving Diana, Vanessa and Eileen to the cemetery, following the hearse. Vanessa remembers when Lucy asked her what God looked like. Vanessa replies jokingly that he would look like Patrick Swayze and that she would look like Jennifer Grey, proving that God does like flat-chested women! Lucy told her to stop obsessing over breasts when Vanessa told her to stop obsessing over God and death. Vanessa had asked Lucy, “What is with you nowadays?” Now, Vanessa realises what was really with her. Vanessa then thinks about the day Lucy got caught raiding the boy’s bunks at camp. Vanessa was reassuring her that nothing too bad would happen. It would just be a small lecture and it would be over, but Vanessa had never realised what Lucy’s parents were really like. The group finally arrives at the cemetery where the priest begins to speak about Lucy. Vanessa looks over at Lucy’s other friends and remember the day when Vanessa asked about their plans after school. Lucy had bit back though, paying her out about playing with her Wonder Woman dolls. Lucy told her that they were too young to be playing dolls in junior high. Vanessa was hurt and ran off in the other direction. Lucy had told her new found friends that Vanessa liked to stuff tissue paper down her top, and upon hearing this, Eileen told Lucy that she had no right to hurt others just because she was hurt inside herself. Lucy’s new friends asked what that meant, but Lucy ignored it. Eileen went to console Vanessa, and told her that she shouldn’t be so upset. It’s just one quarrel, and there’s no doubt that the both of them will be friends again. Vanessa however, told Eileen to get away from her. Vanessa tells Eileen that she never realised all this. She never realised how lonely Lucy must have been. Eileen says that Vanessa is not to blame for this.</p><p>Julia and Diana look on to the two girls and Diana says that the both of them will definitely help each other out through these tough times. Julia talks about Diana being strong in this as well. She remembers when Diana had flown Julia all the way home so she could be with her daughter. Diana remembers when she visited her mother to ask about Lucy’s death. Hippolyta replied that being lonely is like a disease; it’s hard to deal with. They cannot ask for help, and they can’t hear it either. Diana replies that Lucy didn’t seem lonely, she was happy and vibrant. Hippolyta replies that perhaps Lucy was hiding her true feelings. Diana thinks to herself, and wonders if there was anything she could do to save her friend. Julia asks herself why Lucy had done this. It has hurt Vanessa deeply. Her grades are falling, and she’s rude to both students and teachers. She sits alone at lunchtime. The principal suggests taking Vanessa to a psychiatrist. The burial service comes to a close and Vanessa goes to hug Mr. and Mrs. Spears who are standing alone, over their daughter’s grave. Julia then remembers the day how things had changed when she had gone over to Mr. and Mrs. Spears’ house after Lucy’s death.</p><p>Mrs. Spears had yelled at Vanessa, saying that it was her fault. Vanessa started crying and ran towards the car. Julia had yelled back at Mrs. Spears, lecturing her for yelling at Vanessa and putting the blame on her. Mr. Spears had come out and told them to leave before he would call the police. Later that day, Eileen had come to visit Vanessa. Julia then regretted shouting at the Spears. Diana told her that she was simply angry and was only protecting Vanessa. Upstairs, Eileen was trying to convince Vanessa that it wasn’t her fault. It was Lucy who had the problems. Vanessa asks Eileen how she knows all this, and Eileen replies that she’s been through all this. Vanessa wonders how she had not seen this, and she scorns herself for being a terrible friend. Eileen hugs her and tells her that it is not her fault at all.</p><p>Diana then went to visit Lucy’s parents by herself. Mr. Spears told her to leave and should think that Vanessa’s lucky for not being brought up on murder charges. Mrs. Spears then appears and told him to stop being so rude. She apologises for his and hers behaviour from before and invites Wonder Woman into the house. Mrs. Spears brings Diana upstairs to Lucy’s room and she is shocked to see this entire Wonder Woman memorabilia. Mrs. Spears explains that Lucy was jealous of Vanessa because she had a Wonder Woman doll where Lucy had wanted that exact same one, but they had refused to buy her one. She explains that they told Lucy she was too old for dolls, and that if Vanessa had the real thing at her house, then surely, a doll wouldn’t hurt. If they loved her, they would’ve understood. The both of them loved their daughter and would do anything to make her happy. They let her enter beauty pageants. Lucy’s parents didn’t like them because they thought they were degrading, but Lucy said this money won would help her will college. They themselves should have realised what was happened. She was getting A’s in school, and she had wanted to become a beauty queen as well. Mrs. Spears explains that she never goes near the garage anymore because it was <i>her</i> keys that Lucy used to start the car while the garage door was closed.</p><p>Wonder Woman then bids them farewell and tells them that they have to fight through this and that they should never give up. The Spears thank her for her kindness and ask her to apologise on their behalf for Vanessa earlier.</p><p>Back at present day, Vanessa offers Mr. and Mrs. Spears a photograph with a chalk drawing of her and Lucy. Vanessa asks them for their forgiveness and Mrs. Spears hugs Vanessa, telling her that they know she loved Lucy as much as they did.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Mindy Mayer cameo headshot

It is Harmonia, Ares’ daughter who says that there is an imbalance and believes that her dreams about the Talisman she wears has something to do with it. The Fates then show a scene from Harmonia’s past showing her standing with Wonder Woman. It shows Wonder Woman using the Talisman to direct the Demon Plague towards Ares that had absorbed. Harmonia then asks what this means – does it mean that Princess Diana and her are connected in some way? It doesn’t make sense, seeing as they are total opposites of what they stand for. Atropos explains that the Fates will always spin the thread and is unpredictable of what can happen in the future, until the whole knot is done. The Fates then tell the story of Pandora to help Harmonia understand.</p><p>It cuts to a flashback, where Titan has been defeated by the Olympians, and Earth is left barren and destroyed. People pray to for strength, though one refuses and that is Prometheus. He climbs up to Mount Olympus and escapes the guardian, Gryphons. He finds what he needs – a fire for the people. He uses the Aegis to bring it back home. With that, humankind is reclaimed back to its normal state, free from the rule of gods. However, Zeus is angry to discover what happened. Though the Pantheon defends Prometheus and is admired for his bravery. Zeus then orders Hephaestus to make a body with beauty that will compete with a Goddess. And so, the goddesses bless their gifts to this creature: Athena grants her industrious artistry, Hestia grants her nature; Aphrodite grants her beauty, Hermes grants her wit, Demeter grants her the life that will make her happy. They then name the woman Pandora, which means, “The Gift of All”. The Olympians are pleased with their creation and is worthy of Prometheus. Zeus then gives her a small box. It is to be presented to her mate, and is to never open it.</p><p>Hermes takes Pandora to Prometheus’ house, where he is not so eagerly met by Prometheus and his brother, Epimetheus. Prometheus won’t accept the gift however, being very skeptical about the gift. Hermes and Prometheus argue, though Epimetheus interrupts, saying that he will accept the gift on behalf of his brother. Hermes agrees, thinking that a brother accepting is better than no one accepting. Zeus however, isn’t too happy. Prometheus pays for making Zeus where he is on Mount Caucasus with his liver being eaten until thirty generations have passed. Epimetheus is doing better, having Pandora as his lover. However, Pandora was gifted with curiosity, and wants to know what’s in the box. Pandora promises sexual bliss if he opens it. He refuses at first but he eventually gives in, changing the world. The Demon Plague is released, where fear, hatred, jealousy, doubt, mania and depression rear themselves. Epimetheus left Pandora, living on a harsh existence. The only thing that sustains her is hope. Now all that is left of Pandora is the amulet which Harmonia wears. Harmonia looks down at her amulet and wonders what would happen if Pandora hadn’t opened the box. She wonders if it’s all good though, as there is still unhappiness in the world. She then asks if the Demon Plague is truly dead because Diana reminds her of Pandora, and Pandora still haunts her dreams. The Fates continue to explain how Pandora’s fate is still not finished.</p><p>Before the Titans and Olympians existed, Gaea had a tough decision on her hands. She could keep her children close, away from hurt and pain, or push them into the outside world and betraying her heart’s desire. As she accepted her responsibility, she changed into something else and now was called The Pandora. The Goddess who understands her children’s fear and needs. The Pandora reaches into the Great Jar and brings out a pomegranate, which changes into an apple, then into a pear, then into lemon. She tells her children that the trees which grow fruit will sustain them forever, and gives them seeds to plant. She tells her children that beneath the ground, they will find ore and clay. She then uses flint to light a fire. She then gives her children wonder and curiosity, memory and wisdom. She gives them strength, endurance and strength and kindness for all living things. Things grow quite nicely, until time passes and the Titans come along. They wage a war on the Olympians and Gaea is humiliated and raped. After the war, two humans survive: the son of Prometheus, Deukalion and Pyrrha, daughter of Pandora. The Olympians win, however, and he awards his brother, Poseidon, the sea and Hades, ruler of the Underworld. With the clay from the underground, the fire and the Great Jar as trophies, he rides to his new home, Mount Olympus.</p><p>And from Prometheus, with his valiant act, the Great Pandora is changed. She wasn’t a child of Gaea, but created straight from Zeus. She screamed from so much remorse and cried out to Gaea. She responded and so Gaea whispered into Poseidon’s ear. He started to pity Pandora, and so he immersed Pandora with his ocean, until she would called again. It was then Hippolyta who cried the same empty cries, and so from the clay of the seabed which Pandora was immersed from, Diana was born! The Fates explain that the Gods have tried to forget the wars between them, but not even the wisest can look past their own prejudices towards the Pandora Goddess. And any child who was born after this turned against their own mother. Harmonia wonders for a while; the stories end as if she came back willingly, but in her dreams, there are screams and agony.

The Amazons then retaliate with their own firepower. Julia and Steve are horrified and plead with General Masat to be careful and not cut down Hermes and Diana. Faruka, underneath all this commotion says that they need Shim’Tar to help them escape. As she sees the face of Wonder Woman, she senses victory but Diana has other ideas. Wonder Woman then hears the sounds above and wonders where Shim’Tar’s power is coming from. Wonder Woman flies up to stop the planes, but Faruka orders Shim’Tar to stop her. Shim’Tar raises her weapons and fires at Wonder Woman. Then, a pilot sees two women fighting and reports that one looks like Wonder Woman. Osman then demands that Masat cease fire and Steve Trevor reminds him that she is an ambassador and killing her would give him a lot of problems.</p><p>Shim’Tar then fires a weapon and Wonder Woman falls to the ground. She tells her that it is now time for her to die, and they are about to witness the death of “Ariadna”. Wonder Woman realises she has no other way of defending herself and tells Shim’Tar that she has helped destroyed her own city because she was only trying to stop the attackers.</p><p>Faruka comes forward and says that Wonder Woman is lying, just like their previous queen. But their new queen, Shim’Tar will not lie to them. Faruka then orders Wonder Woman to be shot and Shim’Tar raises her weapon at Wonder Woman. Suddenly, a strange hollow thunder is above them and they look at an energy field that is preventing the planes’ attacks. They see that is Hermes and are confused by this… this is a man, helping them. The Amazons then turn back to Faruka and say that she has been lying.</p><p>Back at the camp, Masat is frustrated by the planes’ weapons being deflected. Faruka, angry, raises her weapon and fires at Hermes, saying how she has plotted too long for her plan to be ruined. Shim’Tar is distracted from Hermes’ fall and Wonder Woman uses this time to kick the weapon out of her hand. Batiri shoots Faruka, and tells her sisters that she is the only traitor here. The Amazons then execute Faruka with their own guns.</p><p>Shim’Tar then sees Faruka murdered and is angered that they have destroyed the “New Order”. Wonder Woman is desperate to stop this slaughter when she hears the soft voice of Hermes, telling her that using her lasso is the only way to stop Shim’Tar. Wonder Woman is doubtful but she unhooks her lasso and wraps Shim’Tar with it. Energy surrounds Shim’Tar as she tries to break free from it. Hermes tells Wonder Woman to not let go, though there is a lot of pain coming through. Hermes then orders her to hold his Caduceus. The Amazons scurry for shelter as one Amazon is left standing and that is Batiri. In her arms is Cheetah because if her race is about to die, then she has to remove Ariadna’s cursed spirit.</p><p>Back at the camp, Steve Trevor peers across as he sees a searing light and tells everyone to take cover.</p><p>General Masat’s men then arrive at the blast site and one of them look down from a helicopter from his binoculars and sees what looks like Wonder Woman. Julia sees for herself, and Hermes and Barbara Minerva are down there too. Julia sees Wonder Woman blink and is elated to know that she is alive.</p><p>Down below, Wonder Woman asks what happened to the city. He replies that Bana Mighdall is no more. She still hears Shim’Tars voice which can be found running through her lasso. She tugs on the end of it and on the end is the Gaea’s Girdle. Hermes is shocked as he explains that this was Shim’Tar’s source of power. That was the reason why Hermes told Wonder Woman to wrap her lasso around Shim’Tar – because the corruptness would be revealed. Wonder Woman also wonders how Shim’Tar could harness such power. Before she can get an answer, the helicopter touches down and they all hug, with Barbara Minerva on a stretcher. It is all fine, for the time being.</p><p>After several days, Vanessa hears her name at the arrival’s gate. It is Ed Indelicato and Lt. Mike Shands, saying that they will escort her to the arrival’s gate. She then sees Julia and Diana and hugs both of them. Diana thanks both the men and Ed is flustered. They fight their way through the reporters and into a car.</p><p>For some reason, in Massachusettes, Hermes is getting weaker by the day as Steve explains to Trevor. Etta is also concerned about their relationship and their marriage and she feels that they need to stay apart for a while.</p><p>At the hospital in Cairo, the doctor tells Osman Saukin that Barbara Minerva’s condition has bee stabilized but her body will begin degrading. There’s nothing more that the doctors can do and she will most likely die in a few months. The British Ambassador joins Osman and tells him that the British feel it is their problem. He also remarks that she won’t live long enough for the trial and they do not even have proof of the murders she has committed and wonders if they could keep her away from the public to prevent trouble. The doctor suggests the <a href=""https://comicvine.gamespot.com/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/"" data-ref-id=""4020-31682"">Arkham Asylum</a>.</p><p>Osman tells Julia about Barbara’s situation over the phone and passes the message onto Diana. Diana is packed for home and Julia wishes her a safe journey. She then flies off to the air ready to get back to Paradise Island and celebrate the Feast of Five. Before that, she visits Vanessa at school and wishes her good-bye, Vanessa returning the goodbye with the Amazon salute.</p><p>Hippolyta is waiting on the shores of Paradise Island and Diana addresses them:</p><p>""Forevermore, you shall find strength in these gifts. They are your most sacred birthright - they are your power. You, Hippolyta, shall be Queen over all my daughters. Antiope, you shall rule by your sister's side. See to it that these gifts are never abused and wear you both these symbols of our trust..."" Hippolyta then realises that that is what Artemis said and Diana pulls out Gaea’s Girdle and presents it in front of Hippolyta.</p><p>""Now go, my daughters. Henceforth you shall form a sacred sisterhood. Henceforth you shall be Amazons. And none may resist your power.""</p>",,,,,,,False,115895,"{'icon_url': 'https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/1093/217140-3824-115895-1-wonder-woman.gif', 'medium_url':
