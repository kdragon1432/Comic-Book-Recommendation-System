# The Comic Book Recommendation System #

## Project Overview ##
The comic book industry has been alive and well since the 1940s. With this comes an enormous amount of volumes and issues. That's not even taking account the various reboots, contradicting storylines and similar title names. Altogether, the Marvel and DC fandoms are bethometh messes. 

It is a challenge for vertern fans to navigate. Many new fans are put off by this hurdle. The question of, What shall I read next?, has never been harder to answer!

**Solution**

Using data science and machine learning, the goal is to create a model that will take in user preferences and output comic recommendations. 

The userâ€™s preferences could be based on a favorite character/team, plotline (action/slice of life), favorite writer or artist, etcetc. Recommendations are also based on similarities to between comics that you have read before. These models will be created using various classification machine learning methods and natural language processing. 

The final product should be a simple website created with either HTML/CSS or Ruby to present our findings in an easily digestible method. 

**Impact**

The main service that our solution provides is convenience. The typical reader has to plow through tons of different sites to hunt for descriptions and summaries to decide what to read. This process is even harder for new fans who are not familiar with the comic series. 

Our model does the legwork, saving the user both time and effort. This allows them to effortlessly enjoy reading.
